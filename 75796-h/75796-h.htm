<h2 class="nobreak" id="Foreword"><i>Foreword</i></h2>

</div>

<p>Every citizen has a duty to learn more about the menace
that threatens his future, his home, his children, the peace of
the world—and that is why I have written this book.</p>

<p>If you will take the time to inform yourself, you will find
that communism holds no mysteries. Its leaders have blue-printed
their objectives. The time is far too late not to recognize
this “ism” for what it is: a threat to humanity and to each
of us.</p>

<p>Moreover, there is the sobering fact that since the end of
World War II we have spent billions of dollars to defend
ourselves from communist aggression. This burden will continue
to mount until the world is free from the communist
menace.</p>

<p>This book is an attempt to explain communism—what it
is, how it works, what its aims are, and, most important of
all, what we need to know to combat it.</p>

<p>In writing this book I have been guided by many years of
study and observation of the communist conspiracy in action
in the United States.</p>

<p>As a Special Assistant to the Attorney General of the United
States in 1919, I was assigned to prepare a legal brief on the
newly formed Communist Party and Communist Labor Party.
This necessitated an extensive and penetrating study.</p>

<p>The amount of material was voluminous: Party statements,
resolutions, platforms, news accounts, manifestoes, the very
first documents of American communism. I studied also the
writings of Marx, Engels, and Lenin as well as the activities
of the Third International.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vi"></a>[vi]</span></p>

<p>In this brief, which was submitted to the Attorney General,
I concluded:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">These doctrines threaten the happiness of the community, the
safety of every individual, and the continuance of every home
and fireside. They would destroy the peace of the country and
thrust it into a condition of anarchy and lawlessness and immorality
that passes imagination.</p>

</div>

<p>Today, as I write these words, my conclusions of 1919 remain
the same. Communism is the major menace of our time.
Today, it threatens the very existence of our Western civilization.</p>

<p>In November, 1917, the Bolsheviks seized control in Russia,
gaining state power for the first time. That breach has today
widened into a vast communist empire. The attack is still
being pressed. International communism will never rest until
the whole world, including the United States, is under the
hammer and sickle. This is what has happened to the Russian
people, now held in bondage, who would be free if they
could. (I wish to distinguish here and elsewhere in this book
between these unfortunate millions and the small clique of
communist rulers of Soviet Russia.)</p>

<p>Communism is more than an economic, political, social, or
philosophical doctrine. It is a way of life; a false, materialistic
“religion.” It would strip man of his belief in God, his heritage
of freedom, his trust in love, justice, and mercy. Under communism,
all would become, as so many already have, twentieth-century
slaves.</p>

<p>Ever since 1917, I have observed the rise of international
communism with great concern, particularly communist efforts
to infiltrate and infect our American way of life. The Communist
Party, USA, started in 1919 as a small, disorganized
group of fanatics. Today, it is a dedicated, conspiratorial group
operating under modern conditions as an arm of revolution.
There is no doubt that America is now the prime target of
international communism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_vii"></a>[vii]</span></p>

<p>Obviously, this book does not pretend to disclose a body of
material known exclusively to the FBI. What it does express
is the hope that all of us may develop a shared body of rudimentary
knowledge about communism: a body of knowledge
that we <i>dare not</i> be without. It attempts, in almost primer
form, to set down certain fundamentals of the day-to-day
operations of the Communist Party, USA: how a communist
meeting is conducted; how a top Party official lives; what goes
on in the underground; how discipline is enforced; how Party
members collect money, attend indoctrination schools, hand
out propaganda leaflets. Party members are shown organizing
agitation campaigns, infiltrating noncommunist organizations,
and manipulating communist fronts. The best way to appreciate
the nature and objectives of an enemy is to observe
him in action.</p>

<p>The Communist Party, never forget, is a state within a
state. It has its own system of “courts,” legislative assemblies,
schools, and press. It enforces its own laws, has its own standards
of conduct, and offers its own road to Utopia. The Party
member may physically reside in the United States, but he
“lives” in a communist “world.”</p>

<p>The Party, moreover, serves as a “transmission belt” whereby
the Soviet mentality is being imposed, both directly and indirectly,
on thousands of Americans. The Party’s objective is
to produce a “politically mature” comrade—“communist man”—who
will work ceaselessly for the revolution that would make
our United States part of the Soviet system.</p>

<p>I have deep faith in the American people and in our American
way of life. But I know what communism could do to us.
Not because it is stronger than we are; it is not. Not because
it has something better to offer; it has not. But we may not
learn until it is too late to recognize who the communists are,
what they are doing, and what we ourselves, therefore, must
do to defeat them.</p>

<p>It is my sincere hope that members of the Communist
Party will take the time to read this book—to see how, right
before their eyes, the Party is deceiving them. As we know,
many members, once awakened to the true nature of communism,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
have renounced the Party. By casting aside the communist
spell, these men and women can do much to aid the
cause of freedom.</p>

<p>I have sought to avoid sensationalism, even though much
of the FBI’s work in keeping abreast of day-to-day activities
of American communists makes us ask in wonderment, “Can
this be possible?” To recount the sensational activities of communists
would defeat my objective. My purpose has been to
assemble, organize, and present basic, everyday facts of communism
which will be of maximum help to the people of our
country in recognizing and fighting the enemy in our midst.
Consequently, where illustrative incidents seemed advisable,
I have selected those that have occurred most frequently and
are most typical of the communism that is seeking daily to
undermine our liberties. I have also deliberately avoided
identifying many names and places.</p>

<p>I owe deep thanks to many for help in the preparation of
this book. On the technical side, I am grateful to William I.
Nichols, editor and publisher of <i>This Week</i> magazine, for
much editorial guidance and advice. In a wider sense, I owe
much to the courageous and self-sacrificing men and women
of the FBI who have contributed so greatly to America’s fight
against communism.</p>

<p>But most of all, I have been guided by the thought of millions
of loyal Americans everywhere and in all walks of life.
Never has there been a time when we have so much need for
one another. And we must never forget that if our government
is to remain free, it needs the help of every patriotic man,
woman, and child.</p>

<p>Many Americans have not stopped to realize what a “Soviet
America” would mean. The communists, however, have no
doubts. Their blueprints are already made. So, at the very
outset, let us look at their dream and see what it would mean
to you and me and all the people we know.</p>

<p>In June, 1957, Nikita Khrushchev, Soviet Communist Party
boss, was interviewed before a nation-wide American television
audience. With calm assurance he stated:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... I can prophesy that your grandchildren in America will
live under socialism. And please do not be afraid of that. Your
grandchildren will ... not understand how their grandparents
did not understand the progressive nature of a socialist society.</p>

</div>

<p>William Z. Foster, former National Chairman of the Communist
Party of the United States (now Chairman Emeritus of
the Party’s National Committee), also predicted that this nation
will one day become communist when he stated in 1949,
in dedicating his book, <i>The Twilight of World Capitalism</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">To My Great-Grandson Joseph Manley Kolko Who Will Live
in a Communist United States.</p>

</div>

<p>These words of Russia’s top Party boss and one of the
highest-ranking communists in the United States reveal the
nature of the enemy we face. To make the United States a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
communist nation is the ambition of every Party member,
regardless of position or rank. He works constantly to make
this dream a reality, to steal your rights, liberties, and property.
Even though he lives in the United States, he is a supporter
of a foreign power, espousing an alien line of thought.
He is a conspirator against his country.</p>

<p>The communist is thinking in terms of <i>now</i>, in your lifetime.
Remember that within four decades communism, as a state
power, has spread through roughly 40 per cent of the world’s
population and 25 per cent of the earth’s surface. Some years
ago communists were complaining that their “fatherland,”
Soviet Russia, was encircled, a communist island in a “capitalist”
sea. Today the situation is changed. The world communist
movement is on the march, into Germany, the Balkans, the
Middle East, stretching across the plains of Asia into China,
Korea, and Indochina. Communists have never won over an
entire country by a free election and have never hesitated to
shed blood if this would best serve their purposes. Moreover,
in noncommunist countries thousands of Party members are
working for Moscow. Communists firmly believe they are
destined to conquer the world.</p>

<p>This belief is held in the United States too. A disciplined
Party of hard-core fanatical members is now at work, with
their fellow travelers, sympathizers, opportunists, and dupes.
Communists in our country, though small in numbers, do not
feel lonely. They have faith in the “big Red brother” who will
come to their help. William Z. Foster’s hope, a Red America,
is today inspiring thousands of Party members and sympathizers
to determined effort. They want to add America to
Soviet Russia’s list of conquests.</p>

<p>In recent years there has been a tendency to discount the
menace of domestic communists solely because of a decline in
Party membership. In fact, some have gone so far as to say,
“... the party ... is almost over.” Let’s examine that statement:</p>

<p>In 1922, when Communist Party membership reached
12,400, William Z. Foster said, “... we no longer measure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
the importance of revolutionary organizations by size. In some
places where there are only one or two men, more results are
obtained than where they have larger organizations....”</p>

<p>This has been the communist line down through the years.
Foster in 1951 stated, “Communist strength ... cannot be
measured even approximately by statistics.... The Communist
parties’ strength runs far beyond all formal measurements....”</p>

<p>The Party’s membership in this country reached a low in
1930 when it had 7500 members, and a peak of 80,000 in
1944; its membership at five-year intervals since 1930 has
been as follows: 1935—30,000; 1940—55,000 (a drop of
15,000 from 1939); 1945—64,600 (a drop of 15,400 from
1944); 1950—43,200; 1955—22,600; and by the summer of
1957 membership had further declined. However, over the
years it has been estimated by the communist leaders themselves
that for every Party member ten others are ready, willing,
and able to do the Party’s work.</p>

<p>Fluctuations in the American Party parallel those in foreign
countries. The record clearly establishes that Communist
Parties have the power of swift and solid growth when the
opportunity arises. The following figures reflect how Party
membership can dwindle and then spurt:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">In Italy, Party membership went from 6000 in 1943 to
2,500,000 in 1951; in France, from 20,000 in 1929 to 400,000
in 1956; in Syria, from 250 in 1931 to 10,000 in 1956; in
Brazil, from 25,000 in late 1947 to 100,000 in 1956; and in
Indonesia, from 30,000 in 1953 to 500,000 in 1956.</p>

</div>

<p><i>When the Communist Party was at its peak in the United
States it was stronger in numbers than the Soviet Party was at
the time it seized power in Russia.</i></p>

<p>The size of the Party in the various Soviet satellites at the
time each came under Soviet control discloses how a well-organized
band of revolutionaries can impose its rule over the
majority population:</p>

<p>Under communism, a tiny minority, perhaps ten to twenty
men, would rule the United States. An open dictatorship called
the “dictatorship of the proletariat” would be established. (For
a definition of “dictatorship of the proletariat,” see the Glossary,
<a href="#Page_323">page 323</a>.) Communists, in all their teachings, make this
point clear. The capital city, as one communist leader pointed
out, would be moved from Washington, D.C., to a large industrial
center, probably Chicago. National as well as state
and local governments would be eliminated. “Soviets” (meaning
councils) would be formed throughout the nation. These
would consist of local Communist Party henchmen who would
depose and probably liquidate your mayor, chief of police,
clergymen, and leading citizens.</p>

<p>The Constitution, and all our laws, would be abolished. If
you owned productive property you would be arrested as an
“exploiter,” hauled before a revolutionary court, and sentenced
to a concentration camp—that is, if you convinced the “judge”
you were worth saving at all. All property used in production
would be confiscated, thus leading ultimately to total communization,
meaning state ownership. This confiscation would
include your home, business, bank deposits, and related
personal possessions. These would “belong to everybody.”
You have no “right” to own them under the communist
scheme.</p>

<p>The revolution would affect every man, woman, and child
in America. Communists do not propose to remodel our government
or retain any part of it. They would tear it to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
ground, destroy all opposition, and then create a new government,
an American province in the Soviet world empire. Their
recipe for action? The 1917 Soviet revolution, tailored to
modern conditions. The communists themselves have made
the claim:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The principles upon which a Soviet America would be organized
would be the same, in every respect, as those which
guided the Soviet Union.</p>

</div>

<p>William Z. Foster, long-time head of the communist movement
in our country, has boasted that the communist revolution,
after the actual seizure of power, would “develop even
more swiftly” than the Russian.</p>

<p>All industry would be nationalized and farms taken away
from their owners. A small businessman is just as guilty as a
large businessman; both must be liquidated. Rents, profits,
and insurance would be abolished. Countless occupations,
termed by the communists as “useless and parasitic,” would
be ended. Here is a part of their list: wholesalers, jobbers, real
estate men and stockbrokers, advertising specialists, traveling
salesmen, lawyers, “whole rafts of government bureaucrats,
police, clericals, and sundry capitalist quacks, fakers, and
grafters.” The communists have a special disdain for lawyers.
Perhaps it is because there will be no need for lawyers when
there are no rights to defend. At any rate, Foster has said,
“The pest of lawyers will be abolished.”</p>

<p>Action would be drastic, immediate, and without appeal.
An armed “Red Guard” would enforce the orders of Party
henchmen. Hotels, country clubs, and swimming pools would
be used for the benefit of “workers,” meaning, in most cases,
Party bosses. The workingman in the mines, factories, and
mills would be told to work certain hours for certain wages.
Labor unions, as we know them, would be obliterated. All
such organizations would be owned and operated by the communist
government, and no laborer would be permitted to
organize a union or to strike against his “government.”</p>

<p>The press would be muzzled, free speech forbidden, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
complete conformity demanded. If you expressed an opinion
contrary to the Party line, you should have known better and
your “disappearance” would serve as a lesson for others. Fear
becomes an enforcement technique. Movies, radio, and television
would be taken over by the government as agencies
for government propaganda. Churches would probably not be
closed immediately, but they would be heavily taxed, their
property seized by the state, and religious schools liquidated.
Clergymen would be required to accept the Party line. “God
does not exist. Why worship Him?” say the communists. Children
would be placed in nurseries and special indoctrination
schools. Women, boast the communists, would be relieved of
housework. How? Huge factory and apartment-house kitchens
would be set up, so that women would be “free” to work in
factories and mines along with the men.</p>

<p>This picture of a communist America is not overdrawn.
Here are the words of William Z. Foster:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Under the dictatorship all the capitalist parties—Republican,
Democratic, Progressive, Socialist, etc.—will be liquidated,
the Communist party functioning alone as the Party of the
toiling masses. Likewise, will be dissolved all other organizations
that are political props of the bourgeois rule, including
chambers of commerce, employers’ associations, rotary clubs,
American Legion, Y.M.C.A. and such fraternal orders as the
Masons, Odd Fellows, Elks, Knights of Columbus, etc.</p>

</div>

<p>Under this schedule many Americans are eligible for liquidation
not once but several times, depending on their present
freely chosen affiliations and social interests.</p>

<p>Communism is many things: an economic system, a philosophy,
a political creed, a psychological conditioning, an
educational indoctrination, a directed way of life. Communists
want to control everything: where you live, where you work,
what you are paid, what you think, what streetcars you ride
(or whether you walk), how your children are educated,
what you may not and must read and write. The most minute
details, even the time your alarm clock goes off in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
or the amount of cream in your coffee, are subjects for state
supervision. They want to make a “communist man,” a mechanical
puppet, whom they can train to do as the Party desires.
This is the ultimate, and tragic, aim of communism.</p>

<p>These statements are confirmed, day after day, by documented
reports from areas where communists have already
taken over: Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria, Poland, Roumania,
Czechoslovakia, Red China, and other areas.</p>

<p>When you read such reports, do not think of them as something
happening in a far-off land. Remember, always, that “it
could happen here” and that there are thousands of people
<i>in this country</i> now working in secret to make it happen here.</p>

<p>But also, thank God, there are millions of Americans who
oppose them. If we open our eyes, inform ourselves, and work
together, we can keep our country free.</p>

<i>Marx—And the “Science” of Communism</i></h3>

</div>

<p>The principle of communism is not new. Some primitive
societies practiced a limited brand of communism in that the
whole tribe lived in common and shared property, food, and
housing. But modern-day communism, known as the “science
of Marxism-Leninism,” is just a little over a century old.</p>

<p>This kind of communism is also known as “scientific socialism”
to distinguish it from “Utopian socialism,” which, according
to the Marxists, is unplanned and does not operate
on “laws” of society. “Utopian,” or early, socialism predated
Marx; and its exponents, such as Robert Owen, believed in
making society socialist by peaceful means. Many of these
men were visionaries, hence the word “Utopian.”</p>

<p>A few years before the American Civil War “scientific
socialism” stemmed from the mind of an egotistical, crabby,
stubborn man who from student days showed no interest in
productive labor to support his family and who used to pawn
his overcoat in the middle of winter to buy a few loaves of
bread. This man was born in Germany, became an exile in
France and Belgium, later lived and wrote in England. From
his extensive writings he is known as the “originator” of communism
and is today regarded with the greatest respect by
communists everywhere. His name was Karl Marx.</p>

<p>Marx was born in Trier, Germany, in May, 1818, the son
of a prosperous German lawyer. He was an intelligent child,
but temperamental. At school his marks were superior, and
his capacity for work, a trait that was to continue all through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
life, tremendous. But he did not make friends easily, perhaps
because of self-pride. He made arrogant remarks and wrote
satirical verse. He was a “smart” young man, but already vain,
bitter, and rebellious.</p>

<p>Strangely, his heart held an inner love for a home-town girl,
Jenny von Westphalen, a devotion to remain bright despite
the utter squalor, poverty, and despair that lay ahead. Jenny,
four years older than Karl, was the daughter of a government
official in Trier. She was beautiful, charming, and of a socially
high rank, much higher than that of the Marx family. She, too,
was desperately in love, but she feared to tell her parents.
What would they think—the daughter of Privy Councillor
Ludwig von Westphalen marrying Karl Marx?</p>

<p>Young Karl was obsessed. He wrote feverish love letters
and poetry. “... a new world has opened for me,” he wrote
his father in 1837, “the world of love ... art is not as beautiful
as Jenny.”</p>

<p>The time for marriage, however, was still distant. Karl was
away at school. Then, after graduation, he did not have a job
and did not seem to care to find one—another lifelong trait. He
preferred to dabble in atheism, socialism, and polemics. After
seven long years Jenny was still waiting, but finally, on June
12, 1843, they were married.</p>

<p>Marx had hoped to teach but drifted into journalism. He
wrote acidly, pouring ridicule on everything and everybody
with whom he disagreed. Strongly influenced by the teachings
of Ludwig Feuerbach, a German philosopher who preached
materialism, Marx had become an atheist and called for war
against religion, a war that was to become the cornerstone of
communist philosophy. In 1842 he became editor of a new
left-wing paper, the Cologne <i>Rheinische Zeitung</i>, and immediately
launched into bitter tirades against the Prussian
government. As expected, the authorities took action, the
paper was suppressed, and Marx, a short time later, went to
France. Finally, in 1849, with his family, he went to England,
where he was destined to remain until his death in 1883.</p>

<p>Marx was a man with few friends. But one friend, Friedrich
Engels, a fellow German whom he first met in 1842, was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
become his intellectual comrade, his financial support, his
faithful champion. Engels, a vivid contrast to the morose and
crotchety Marx, was gay, mannerly, from a wealthy family,
and interested in having a good time. He too was an atheist
and a revolutionary, a fact that deeply offended his father, a
leading textile manufacturer and churchman. He would provide
money for school, the elder Engels said, but none for
revolutionary activities. Conflict was inevitable. “If it were not
for my mother ... whom I really love,” young Engels wrote,
“it would never occur to me to make even the smallest concession
to my fanatical and despotic father.”</p>

<p>Marx and Engels were close friends for some forty years.
Engels, most appropriately, can be called the “collaborator”
of Marx. He had an encyclopedic memory and his far-flung
interests and knowledge of industrial techniques supplied
Marx with important information. He also wrote independently
and, in some instances, under Marx’s name (For a list
of writings by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, see pages 333-337.)
Together they conceived and formulated the doctrine
of communism. They were the parents of “scientific socialism.”</p>

<p>Engels spent much of his time in Manchester, England,
tending to his father’s business, while Marx lived in London.
Engels was tall and thin, blue-eyed, two years younger than
Marx, and a lover of horses and women. He lived for years
with one girl without marriage and then, upon her death, with
her sister. He finally consented to marry the latter on her
deathbed.</p>

<p>Marx, in contrast, lived in squalor. He was often sick; he
suffered from boils, headaches, and rheumatism. Jenny’s
health began to give way. Her seventh child was born dead.
She became wretchedly nervous, irritable, and upset. “Daily,
my wife tells me she wishes she were lying in the grave with
the children,” Marx wrote in 1862. “And truly I cannot blame
her....”</p>

<p>Marx did not have a regular job but depended on pittances,
especially from Engels. He lived from pawnshop to pawnshop.
It is a bitter irony of history, indeed, that the founder of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
communism should be literally kept alive by a wealthy industrialist,
and that a “capitalist’s” son, turned communist, should
become the second “father” of this revolutionary movement.</p>

<p>The great classics of communism, such as <i>Das Kapital</i> (<i>Capital</i>),
were “hacked out” amid the most trying conditions. For
a period the Marx family lived in two furnished rooms on
Dean Street, Soho (London). Listen to this description translated
from an article by Gustav Mayer:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">In private life Marx is a highly disorderly, cynical person....
Washing himself, combing his hair, changing his underwear
and shirts are a rarity with him.... He is often lazy for days,
but if he has a great deal of work, he works day and night
with untiring endurance. Very often he stays up the entire
night and then lies down on the couch fully dressed at noon
and sleeps through until evening, undisturbed by the hustle
and bustle of family life.... The room overlooking the street
is the parlor and the bedroom is to the rear. In the entire
apartment there is not a single piece of clean and good furniture.
Everything is broken, tattered and ragged; everything
is covered with finger-thick dust, everywhere there is the
greatest disorder. In the center of the parlor stands a large
table covered by an overhanging oilcloth. It is cluttered with
his manuscripts, books, newspapers, the children’s toys, scraps
of cloth from his wife’s sewing as well as some tea-cups with
chipped rims, dirty spoons, knives, forks, a lamp, an inkwell,
drinking glasses, a Dutch claypipe, and ashes. In short, all
this conglomeration is piled high and on one table. A junk-shop
would have to cede honors to this extraordinary ensemble.
When stepping into Marx’s room the coal and tobacco smog
makes one grope around the room as in a cave until one’s
eyes gradually develop a tolerance to these fumes and one is
able to make out, as if in a fog, a few objects in the room.
Everything is dirty; everything is full of dust. As for sitting
down, that is a really dangerous matter. Here is a chair with
only three legs; over there the children are playing at cooking
on another chair which happens to be still unbroken. Sure
enough, that is the one which is offered to the visitor, but
without any effort to clean off the food. You sit down at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
risk of ruining a pair of trousers.... Such is a faithful picture
of the family life of the Communist chief, Marx....</p>

</div>

<p>Money was always short. Little Franziska died before her
first birthday. There was no money for the funeral. A pittance
was obtained from a neighbor which, as Jenny says, “... paid
for the small coffin in which my poor child now sleeps in
peace.” Marx sometimes couldn’t go out of the house: his
overcoats were pawned. His wife was sick, but he couldn’t call
a doctor. There was no money for medicine. “For a week or
more I have kept my family alive feeding them bread and
potatoes, and it is questionable whether or not I will be able
to scare any up today.” Another time he complained, “... the
children are without clothes or shoes in which they can leave
the house.”</p>

<p>But Marx was stubborn. He kept plugging away, writing,
reading, denouncing “capitalist” poverty, and letting his family
starve. No wonder a remark, attributed to his mother, was
made that instead of writing about capital it would have been
better if Karl had made some. The main source of help was
money from Engels, from a relative, or from writings. The
“only piece of good news we have,” Marx wrote to Engels on
February 27, 1852, “is from my ministerial sister-in-law [wife
of the Minister of Westphalia], namely, the news about the
illness of my wife’s indestructible uncle. If the brute dies now,
I will be out of this mess.” Marx, in scornfully referring to his
wife’s uncle as “indestructible,” meant the fellow simply would
not die. On March 2, 1852, Engels replied, “My congratulations
on the news of the old ... inheritance-obstructor’s illness
and I hope that the catastrophe will finally take place.”</p>

<p>If the mind of Marx was perverted and biased, it was at the
same time sharp and keen. He was a deep student of history,
philosophy, and economics. Sitting in his dingy apartment or
in the British Museum, this German-born social theorist surveyed
the world. In his arrogant pride he thought he could
recast it on his own terms; through his writings and his revolutionary
organizations he undertook to do so.</p>

<p>“The Moor,” as his children called him because of his coal-black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
hair and eyes, developed as his first line of attack an
atheistic view of the world. He joined two very old ideas:
(1) That everything in the universe, whether a blade of grass,
a human being, or society itself, is constantly changing and at
the same time is in conflict. This is called <i>dialectics</i>. (2) That
God doesn’t exist and the world is composed only of “living”
matter. Hence, man is walking dust, without spark or image of
his divine Creator. This idea is called <i>materialism</i>; hence,
<i>dialectical materialism</i>. (For a fuller definition of this and
other communist terms, see the Glossary.)</p>

<p>This concept was to undergird the whole communist “world
outlook.” Human society, as well as the physical universe,
Marx said, is affected by this outlook. The principles have
universal application. Noncommunist thinkers, as well as
human experience, have punctured many holes in the thesis;
but to communists it applies with the same certainty as does
the law of gravity.</p>

<p>Constant and bitter struggle is not bad, Marx said, because
it achieves progress. In fact, he viewed the whole recorded
history of the world as a story of class struggle. Mankind, he
said, has always been divided into <i>classes</i>: groups of people
who have special interests, ideals, and ways of doing things.
These classes, he added, have been struggling from the very
beginning of time, and still are.</p>

<p>Marx explained this struggle by means of a special formula,
commonly called the <i>thesis-antithesis-synthesis</i> dialectic, which
he distorted from the philosophy of the famous German philosopher,
G. W. F. Hegel. Here is how it works for communists:</p>

<p>Start, for example, Marx said, with a certain economic class
(a <i>thesis</i>). This class is the dominant power in society, controlling
the means of production, the way houses are built,
the kind of clothes worn, and so forth. Soon an opposing class
arises (an <i>antithesis</i>) which seeks to overthrow the first class.
It has different ideals, motives, and ambitions. What happens?
A fight occurs and soon a new class (<i>synthesis</i>) emerges
which, according to Marx, incorporates only the best of both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
old classes. (Why some of the bad does not seep in, too, Marx
does not explain.)</p>

<p>Then the process starts all over again. This is history, for as
Marx held, historical materialism was nothing more than
applying the concept of dialectical materialism to society. The
new class (<i>synthesis</i>) is now dominant and thus becomes, in
turn, a new <i>thesis</i>. It directs how to build houses, who gains
wealth, etc., but, following Marx’s ideas, another opposition
class arises (a new <i>antithesis</i>). They struggle, a new <i>synthesis</i>
is obtained, and again the world is off on a new cycle.</p>

<p>These ideas obviously are distorted and theoretical. But to
understand modern-day communism, it is essential to grasp
the underlying theory. False as it is, this theory is the spark
that kindles the communist flame</p>

<p>This class struggle, in Marx’s reasoning, always produced a
higher stage of civilization. First, years ago, came slavery.
The slave-owning class, as expected, developed its own “antithesis”
(meaning its rivals, who wanted to abolish slavery).
A struggle ensued and feudalism developed, representing the
best of both opponents. But feudal society, then the dominant
class, was attacked by its own “antithesis,” forces within its
body which opposed its ideas. For hundreds of years this
struggle continued, issuing forth finally in a new “synthesis”
(capitalism), again representing the best features of both
rivals.</p>

<p>When Marx wrote, history was still in the capitalist stage,
but he said it could not remain there. It must (there was no
alternative) move on to communism. The capitalist class had
already developed its own “antithesis,” which Marx identified
as the “proletariat” (the working class), which was striving to
overthrow the old system.</p>

<p>Communism, Marx proclaimed, represented the new “synthesis”
of the capitalist-proletariat struggle and the apex of all
history. At this point, said Marx, conflict would now cease,
although, again, he does not say why. This new world would
be the “perfect” and “final” society: stateless, classless, godless,
where all property used in production would be held in
common, and human activities would conform to the principle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
“from each according to his abilities, to each according to his
needs.”</p>

<p>Marx, with shrewd cunning, applied these concepts to the
society of his day. He aimed this appeal to catch everyone
who was greedy, ambitious, discontented, or downtrodden.
Also, since the Industrial Revolution had led to some very
real social abuses, the doctrines of Marx appealed to many
sincere idealists and reformers who were impatient with slower
and more gradual methods of improvement. The class struggle,
Marx said, was now in progress between the “capitalists,”
who owned the tools of production, such as factories, railroads,
mines, and the “proletariat,” or people employed by the capitalists—the
wage earners, the “propertyless,” the “exploited.”</p>

<p>When Marx wrote, capitalists were the dominant class. According
to his interpretation, they set economic levels, what
wages could be paid, what standards of living the workers
could have, what social customs would prevail. They were the
greedy “exploiters,” wanting more and more profits. But, said
Marx, according to his “law,” capitalists were digging their
own graves. The very rise of capitalism, Marx emphasized,
called into existence its conqueror, the proletariat. The higher
the state of capitalism, as then rising in France and England,
the greater the number of workers required to tend the mills,
mines, and shops; hence, the larger the proletariat would become.
Wealth would accumulate in the hands of fewer and
fewer people, the masses would become increasingly poor.
Thus, conflict between the two classes was inevitable.</p>

<p>Already, Marx said, this conflict was in progress, as witnessed
by European strikes, lockouts, and revolutions. The
proletariat was striking against its oppressors, and the result
of the struggle would be communism. The working class was
destined to win. That was the “law.” This was the way Marx
viewed history and how he distorted events and situations to
support his thesis, which followers were later to call a
“science.” This “science” has long since been disproved by
man’s experience and the record of events and situations in
the free world.</p>

<p>In this struggle between the capitalist class and the proletariat,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
what is the role of the Communist Party? The Party,
said Marx, was to be the vanguard of the proletariat. Most
workers are stupid, uneducated in Marxism, and duped by
capitalists. They could never start a revolution by themselves.
They need guidance, the job of the Communist Party. Communists
are wide awake, intelligent, and, most important of
all, “learned” in Marxism. They know the “laws” of revolution,
the “mysteries” of the development of society. Their task: to
be the “general staff” of the revolution.</p>

<p>What about force and violence? Must they be used? Marx
emphasized that capitalist society, most naturally, would not
voluntarily turn over its factories, banks, and money to the
workers. Moreover, it would probably organize a “counter-revolution”—which
means defending itself. Hence, under the
leadership of the Communist Party, the workers must, if necessary,
be prepared to use force, that is, violent revolution. If
the capitalists submit peacefully, good; if they resist, slaughter
them.</p>

<p>But this is not all. After power is seized, opposition will remain
which must be stamped out, utterly, completely, mercilessly.
Again, this is a job that cannot be left to an untrained,
untaught proletariat. It is a job, according to Marxist thought,
for the <i>dictatorship of the proletariat</i>, conceived as a transitional
stage between actual revolution and the arrival of the
highest and final form of communism.</p>

<p>Who would direct the dictatorship? The Communist Party,
of course. And what would it do? It would serve as a steam-roller,
liquidating through sheer force all “capitalist” elements.
Then, and only then, could new “socialist” construction begin.
The dictatorships in Russia and the satellite countries with
their secret police, slave labor camps, and mass regimentation
are living examples of the “dictatorship of the proletariat” in
action.</p>

<p>These were, and are, vicious principles, destined to shake
civilization to its roots. In 1848, Marx, in collaboration with
Engels, prepared the platform of the Communist League, a
revolutionary organization which included a large number of
German exiles. This was the famous <i>Communist Manifesto</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
the first sweeping blueprint of communist aims. The language
is violent, the threats dire. “A spectre is haunting Europe—the
spectre of Communism,” it starts off, and ends by calling for
a violent overthrow of existing society. “The Communists disdain
to conceal their views and aims.... Let the ruling classes
tremble at a Communist revolution. The proletarians have
nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win.
Workingmen of all countries, unite!”</p>

<p>Well-intentioned and goodhearted men, Marx said, cannot
be depended on to improve society. They are dabblers and
botchers who make things worse. Mere social reforms
strengthen capitalism, prolong “exploitation,” and keep the
corpse alive. Tear capitalism down, completely. Use force and
violence. Set up a communist government!</p>

<p>To the very end of his life Marx remained a ruthless fighter.
Invective, anger, and abuse were his weapons. He defiantly
defended his position against all comers. He bitterly denounced
all who dared disagree with him, such as Ferdinand
Lassalle, the German Socialist leader, and Mikhail Bakunin,
the Russian anarchist. He fought wordy battles that lasted
for years. Always, by skill or skulduggery, he tried to impose
his point of view. If he found that impossible, he worked
furiously to destroy his opponent.</p>

<p>In 1864 Marx was involved in founding the First International,
a motley group of “radicals,” “have-nots,” “socialists,”
and “anarchists.” A number of congresses were held, but little
was accomplished. Finally, in 1872, after many feuds and
quarrels in which Marx was deeply involved, he succeeded in
having the group’s headquarters transferred from London to
New York, then considered a remote outpost. This was a move
made out of spite, Marx preferring to see the organization die
rather than fall into the hands of his enemies. In 1876, at a
congress in Philadelphia, it was dissolved. The First International’s
chief legacy to the cause of world communism lay
in giving international structure, for the first time, to communist
ideas.</p>

<p>Here is another irony of communism. This man who attacked
the domination of the capitalists showed his own dominating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
nature again and again. In theory, he was “for” the
common man and wanted to correct the ills of society. In
practice, his fanatical intolerance and overbearing ego made
him a tyrant, an autocrat, a dictator.</p>

<p>Marx’s character helped shape the whole philosophy of
communism and, as we shall see, forged a hideous instrument
of power for those who were to follow him.</p>

<i>Lenin—And the Russian Revolution</i></h3>

</div>

<p>Marx and Engels formulated the basic doctrines of modern
communism. However, they supplied few guides to everyday
revolutionary activity.</p>

<p>Remaining in the Marx-Engels stage, communism might
well have been drowned in an ocean of angry words, manifestoes,
quarrels, and personal feuds. If so, the world today
would be a much different place for all of us.</p>

<p>But there was another man, whom Marx and Engels never
knew, Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov, later known as Lenin. It was
Lenin’s destiny to lead the first successful communist revolution,
about which Marx and Engels had dreamed so long. He
was the man who took communist <i>theory</i> and galvanized it
into communist <i>organization</i> and <i>action</i>. Lenin’s activation of
communist theory resulted in the seizing of power in Russia.
Lenin stands today, just after Marx and Engels, as the movement’s
third force. More than any other man he is the “developer”
of modern-day communism and the father of Party
structure and dictatorship. His importance is reflected in the
communist description of its way of life as the “science of
Marxism-Leninism.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>Today Lenin’s prestige has been inflated even more as a
result of the “downgrading” of Stalin. He is looked upon as
the “ideal” communist leader and, in the words of N. A. Bulganin,
Chairman of the U.S.S.R. Council of Ministers, “the
great founder of our party and the Soviet State.”</p>

<p>Lenin was born April 22, 1870, in Simbirsk, now Ulyanovsk
(changed after Lenin’s death in 1924), a town on the Volga
River, deep in Russia. His father was a school inspector and a
devout member of the Russian Orthodox Church. Vladimir,
one of six children, was a model student. He had a great
capacity for concentration and could quickly answer his
father’s questions about schoolwork.</p>

<p>Youth, however, was short-lived; Lenin soon was on the
way to becoming a “revolutionary.” It is interesting and important
to note here, as with Marx and Engels, that atheism
was the first step toward communism. At the age of sixteen,
as he later said, Lenin ceased to believe in God. It is reported
that he tore the cross from his neck, threw this sacred relic
to the ground, and spat upon it.</p>

<p>Soon after, in 1887, when Lenin was seventeen, Alexander
Ulyanov, his elder brother and boyhood hero, was hanged in
the courtyard of Schlusselburg Fortress in Saint Petersburg,
later known as Petrograd and Leningrad, along with four
companions, charged with conspiracy to assassinate the Czar
of Russia. Alexander was a member of People’s Will, a revolutionary
organization. This event deeply affected young Lenin.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1887 Vladimir entered Kazan University and
soon became involved in student disorders. He was arrested
and lived for a while under police surveillance. A short time
later, at the age of eighteen, he started reading Karl Marx and
soon was expounding Marxist principles to his sister Anna and
organizing Marxist discussion groups. In 1891, in Saint Petersburg,
he passed his law examination with honors and was admitted
to the bar. Although young in years, he was “old” in
disposition. At the age of twenty-four, a companion remarked,
Lenin already had a tired-looking face. His head was entirely
bald, except for fringes of hair at the temples. “The most
striking thing about him,” went another description, “was his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
large head, with its large white forehead. His rather small
eyes seemed perpetually narrowed, his glance was serious....”</p>

<p>Within a few short years Lenin was to dominate the Russian
Marxist movement. This man who loved to play with
children, who, after he became dictator of all Russia, occasionally
liked to sleep in a hayloft rather than in a bed, was
utterly cynical and ruthless. In one instance an associate in
Stockholm complained that couriers were not delivering newspapers
on schedule. “Please send me their names,” Lenin
curtly ordered. “These saboteurs shall be shot.”</p>

<p>Another time a companion complained about his work.
Shut up, were Lenin’s orders. “I will turn you over to the
party court; we will shoot you.” Without tenderness, with not
a muscle responsive to mercy, he had one goal—revolution.
For twenty years, whether as an exile in Siberia or as a wandering
conspirator in Europe, he kept working, dreaming, and
thinking about revolution. Guided by his “evil genius,” he
never deviated from that goal.</p>

<p>Russia, by the 1880’s, was seething with discontent. A strong
revolutionary movement, dating from the 1820’s, was in rebellion
against the despotic Czarist regime. Many of the suggested
revolutionary programs were impractical. Some demanded
greater voice for the peasants or industrial workers;
some espoused violent revolution; others, democratic reform.
But on one point they all agreed: there must be a change.
The more radical groups believed in political terrorism. Their
violent escapades, however, such as assassinations, led only
to greater oppression.</p>

<p>Marxist writings had early found their way into Russia.
The first language into which Marx’s <i>Das Kapital</i> (originally
written in German) had been translated was Russian. Many
revolutionaries were attracted by these new communist ideas.
In 1883 a Marxist group was founded. Ten years later, when
Lenin joined an underground group in Saint Petersburg, the
movement was strong.</p>

<p>These early Russian Marxists, however, were deeply divided.
They were babblers of theory, not apostles of action.
Lenin immediately undertook to change the situation. But in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
December, 1895, he was arrested, imprisoned, and later
exiled to Siberia.</p>

<p>In 1900 he was released and fled from Russia, more ardent
than ever for revolution. With fiendish devotion and intensity
he set about the task of creating a revolutionary organization
that could seize power in Russia.</p>

<p>For most of the time after 1900 Lenin and his wife, Nadezhda,
lived as exiles in Western Europe, going from city to
city, often under aliases. Nadezhda in writing about Lenin
gave a vivid account of their life in cheap boardinghouses. In
Switzerland, on one occasion, they stayed in a room where the
windows could be opened only at night because of the “intolerable
stench” of a nearby sausage factory. Another time they
took their meals at a house where, in the words of Lenin’s
wife, “the very ‘lower depths’ of Zurich” congregated.</p>

<p>Lenin was happiest when he could talk revolution. Nadezhda
was constantly on guard to protect his health. Many
times Lenin, engrossed in revolutionary activities, would work
himself into a highly nervous state. One time, Nadezhda
writes, he “came home after a heated debate ... I could
hardly recognize him, his face was so drawn and he could
barely speak.” She encouraged him to take a vacation. In
London, Lenin “developed a nervous illness called ‘holy
fire.’” Nadezhda, after consulting a medical student, painted
him with iodine. She, however, couldn’t prevent her husband,
lost in thought while pedaling a bicycle, from running into the
back of a tram and “very nearly” knocking out an eye.</p>

<p>Borrowing from the autocratic character of Marx himself,
Lenin made Marxism a highly disciplined, organized, and
ruthless creed. How can revolution be achieved? Not by
democratic reforms, ballots, or good will but by naked, bloody
violence. The sword is the weapon. Everything must be dedicated
to this aim: one’s time, talents, one’s very life. Revolutions
do not just happen. They are made.</p>

<p>Lenin conceived of the Party as a vehicle of revolution.
Marx, in his philosophical abstractions, had never thought out
the day-to-day composition of the Party. Lenin did. The
Party must be a small, tightly controlled, deeply loyal group.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Fanaticism, not members, was the key. Members must live,
eat, breathe, and dream revolution. They must lie, cheat, and
murder if the Party was to be served. Discipline must be
rigid. No deviations could be permitted. If an individual
falters, he must be ousted. Revolutions cannot be won by
clean hands or in white shirts; only by blood, sweat, and the
burning torch. These ideas were all inherent in Marxist
thought, but they waited for Lenin to translate them into
organized action.</p>

<p>In 1903 the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (which
was the Russian Marxist Party) met in convention in Brussels.
The proceedings were later transferred to London, after
Belgian authorities had warned several of the delegates to
leave the city. One session of the congress was routed by an
army of vermin.</p>

<p>A dispute arose. Should Party membership be restricted
or open to anybody? Lenin fought for restricted membership
and won. His group was called the Bolsheviks (the majority);
the losers became the Mensheviks (minority). The Party,
Lenin said, must be composed only of trained revolutionaries.
To allow anybody, curiosity seekers, the halfhearted, weaklings,
to join would reduce the Party’s discipline, striking
power, and fanaticism. The masses couldn’t be trusted to make
a revolution. They would run at the first sound of gunfire.
What were needed were men willing to die because the Party
told them to die. This principle of Party organization remains
in full effect today throughout the communist world.</p>

<p>Lenin was an able propagandist and agitator. He thought
chiefly in terms of battle plans, tactics, and strategy rather
than of theories or philosophical abstractions. In 1900, from
his exile in Europe, he helped found a revolutionary paper,
<i>Iskra</i> (the <i>Spark</i>), printed in Germany but smuggled into
Russia. (A young ex-seminary student in southern Russia,
Joseph Vissarionovich Djugashvili, later known as Stalin, was
a reader of <i>Iskra</i>.) This paper offered directions to the secret
revolutionaries in Russia, told them the “line” to follow, urged
better Party organization. In addition, Lenin pounded out his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
“rules of revolution” in articles and pamphlets that were
widely circulated in the Russian underground.</p>

<p>Though militant himself, Marx was never able, in his detached
atmosphere, to instill the spirit of militant action into
communist policy as did Lenin. The crafty Russian, brought
up in an atmosphere of revolutionary agitation, did not shrink
from any crime. He held that there could be no hesitation or
vacillation. Use any weapon—knife, hatchet, or gun—to
achieve your aim, he urged. A man was either your friend or
your foe. Find out quickly. If a friend, clasp his hand; that is,
as long as he served a purpose. If a foe, take drastic action.</p>

<p>All during his lengthy exile Lenin was constantly studying,
writing, debating, and expounding revolutionary principles.
Like Marx, he used the facilities of Western democracy, such
as the great library of the British Museum, to undermine the
very freedom that gave him this opportunity. Nadezhda tells
of his studies in the Geneva library:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">He would again take out the books left unfinished the day
before. They would be about barricade-fighting or the technique
of offensives. He would go to his customary place at the
little table by the window, smooth down the thin hair on his
bald head with a customary gesture, and bury his nose deep
in the books. Only rarely would he get up, and then in order
to take down a dictionary from a shelf and search for the
explanation of some unfamiliar term. He would then stride up
and down for a while, resume his seat, and in a tense manner
rapidly scrawl something in minute handwriting on little
squares of paper.</p>

</div>

<p>These studies, as later events were to prove, helped produce
practical and concrete ways of making revolutions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">[Lenin, says Nadezhda] not only read through, thoroughly
studied, and thought over everything that Marx and Engels
had written on revolution and insurrection. He also perused
numerous works on the art of warfare, considering the technique
and the organisation of the armed insurrection from all
standpoints. He was occupied with this work much more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
people realised, and his talk about “shock” groups during the
civil war and “groups of five and ten” was not the chatter of
a layman, but a well-thought-out proposition.</p>

</div>

<p>Lenin labored day and night for seventeen years in perfecting
his plans for the revolution. His opportunity was to
come in November, 1917.</p>

<p>In March, 1917, revolution erupted in Russia. The German
army had defeated Russian troops. The Czar’s government
was tottering, and a liberal regime, later headed by Alexander
Kerensky, assumed control. The Czar was forced to abdicate.
This was the signal for Russian revolutionaries of all types to
return to Petrograd: Lenin from Switzerland, aided by the
German High Command; Leon Trotsky, later to become a
high official in the Bolshevik regime, from New York City;
Stalin from Siberian exile.</p>

<p>Lenin plotted against Kerensky, eagerly awaiting the moment
he could overthrow the new government. He created
dissension in the armed forces. He refused to cooperate with
the government except on his own terms. All the time he was
desperately building up and training his Bolshevik Party.
Lenin had a “sixth sense” in diagnosing revolutionary situations.
He knew when to act and when not. Like a crafty tiger,
he was circling his prey. Lenin was the true leader of the
Russian revolution. Stalin, fresh from Siberia, was relatively
unknown, but he was learning the skills of deceit and murder
that were soon to catapult him to power.</p>

<p>In the fall of 1917, the Bolsheviks seized power in the October
Revolution. Lenin became the dictator of all Russia. Communism
had made its first breach in the wall of capitalism.
(The revolution occurred on October 25, 1917, according to
the Eastern calendar then in use in Russia. Hence, the term
“October Revolution.” Under the Western calendar, later
adopted by the Soviets, the date is November 7, 1917.)</p>

<p>The Bolsheviks immediately instituted a terroristic “dictatorship
of the proletariat.” Marx had conceived the dictatorship
of the proletariat as a transitory period for the establishment
of a communist society. Lenin, however, dipped it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
in blood and gave it a prominence and ruthlessness that
shocked the entire world. The secret police, then known as
the Cheka, instituted a reign of terror; capital punishment was
meted out widely. A search for enemies rocked the country.
<i>Pravda</i>, the Party newspaper, urged drastic measures.</p>

<p>The Czar and members of his family were executed by the
Bolsheviks and their bodies destroyed. Here is an eyewitness
account by Leonid Krassin, a member of the early Bolshevik
government, as related by his wife, Lubov Krassin:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... we went through a period of so-called “Terror”.... About
six hundred to seven hundred persons were shot in Moscow
and Petrograd, nine-tenths of them having been arrested quite
at random or merely as suspect of belonging to the Right Wing
of the S. R.’s [Socialist Revolutionaries, a Russian revolutionary
party], or else of being counter-revolutionaries. In the provinces
this developed into a series of revolting incidents
such as arrests, executions en masse, and wholesale eviction of
bourgeois and educated people from their houses, leaving
them homeless.</p>

</div>

<p>The test of loyalty was often to what class the individual
belonged, the extent of his education, how he was dressed,
how much food he had in his house. If his pantry was too well
stocked or his clothes too new, he might be accused of being
an exploiter and sent before an execution squad.</p>

<p>This was an example of the dictatorship of the proletariat
in action. This was a first step toward what Marx proclaimed
as the “final” and “perfect” state of society, which is as visionary
now as it was then. Millions of Russians found themselves
gripped by a tyranny incomparably worse than that of the
Czar.</p>

<p>Oddly, despite the predictions of Marx, communism seized
power in a country where Marx would least have expected it.
Marx had prophesied that the revolution was destined to
occur in a highly industrialized nation. Russia was industrially
backward.</p>

<p>During the years 1917-20 the Bolsheviks were forced to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
fight for survival, first against the German army, then in a war
with Poland. Also, the White Russians, a vigorous anti-Bolshevik
group, assembled powerful military forces. A bitter White-Red
civil war raged.</p>

<p>Lenin’s answer was a policy of “war communism.” Most
industry was nationalized. Trade and commerce were officially
abolished. The government undertook to distribute manufactured
articles to the people. In agricultural regions food
supplies were openly confiscated. Poor peasants were assembled
in committees to spy on their richer neighbors who
might be hiding grain. The setting of class against class was
an established tactic of communism.</p>

<p>By 1921, when the last “enemies” had been driven from
Russia, the nation was a shambles. The Bolsheviks, trying to
adapt Marxist theory to a nation predominantly rural, had
compounded confusion. Industrial production was down, peasants
were in open revolt. Private incentive had been ruined.
By 1922 famine raged, with tens of millions of people starving
or on a semistarvation diet. Some estimates place the loss of
life at five million. This was Russia’s introduction to communism.</p>

<p>Fanatical Lenin, after years of working for the revolution,
would not let it slip away from him now. He struck back
furiously. Slave labor camps were increased; dreaded secret
police compelled conformity; churches were closed. “Enemies
of the people,” those who opposed the Bolsheviks, were ruthlessly
executed. Uprisings were cruelly suppressed.</p>

<p>However, terror was not the answer. In March, 1921, sailors
of the Red navy in Kronstadt, formerly strong Bolshevik supporters,
rebelled. Lenin, with his keen sense of timing, realized
that a change had to be made.</p>

<p>The result was the NEP—New Economic Policy. Capitalist
practices, so denounced by the Bolsheviks, were temporarily
introduced to save the Russian government. Peasants were
now allowed to keep surpluses of grain after taxation, instead
of having them confiscated. They could even dispose of their
surplus products as they chose, and private trade was allowed
to develop. In the industrial field many businesses were returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
to private owners, although the government retained
control over larger concerns.</p>

<p>To the surprise of Bolshevik leaders the NEP proved a
relative success. It gave them the breathing spell they so
desperately needed to consolidate their gains. Both agricultural
and industrial production jumped. Lenin never lived to
see the final results of the temporary NEP, but the revolution
was no longer in immediate danger.</p>

<p>Lenin’s scheming mind was laying the groundwork for
extending the communist conspiracy throughout the world. In
March, 1919, Lenin founded the Third International (better
known as the Communist International or Comintern). The
Third International was a keystone of Soviet policy, whereby
Moscow, through Bolshevik discipline, could guide the activities
of communists around the world, including those in the
United States. To the communists, victory in Russia was only
the first step. The whole world, they said, must go communist.
“... victory is ours,” Lenin proclaimed at the First Congress
of the Comintern in 1919; “the victory of the world
Communist revolution is assured.” In early days the regime
confidently expected communist revolutions in Western Europe.
A communist regime sprang briefly into power in
Hungary, another flickered in Germany. Although no permanent
communist successes were achieved outside Russia,
an effective agency of conspiracy now existed to undermine
noncommunist governments.</p>

<p>The skill of Lenin simply cannot be overestimated. He
introduced into human relations a new dimension of evil and
depravity not surpassed by Genghis Khan or Attila. His concept
of Party supremacy, girded by ruthless and ironclad discipline,
gave communism a fanaticism and an immorality that
shocked Western civilization. Countless individuals, some in
high places, simply did not believe that men could behave as
did the Bolsheviks; that brutality, terror, and the utter meaninglessness
of human dignity could be a policy of state. But
that was the contention, and the legacy, of Lenin.</p>

<p>Underlying all of Lenin’s thoughts and actions was the use
of naked force to achieve Party ends. He held that there could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
be no permanent coexistence between communists and noncommunists.
The latter must be liquidated, by force if necessary.
“Marxists have never forgotten that violence will be an
inevitable accompaniment of the collapse of capitalism on its
full scale and of the birth of a socialist society.”</p>

<p>Lenin liked to use the word “ruthless,” which is a clue to
his thinking:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There is still too little of that ruthlessness which is indispensable
for the success of socialism....</p>

</div>

<p>This is the Lenin who has always been hailed by the Moscow
ruling hierarchy as the guiding genius of communism in
Russia and in this country. In fact, with the downgrading of
Stalin, Lenin became increasingly extolled in Russia as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
“guide to communist action.” Nikita Khrushchev, speaking
before the Twentieth Congress of the Russian Communist
Party in February, 1956, stated categorically:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The central committee has always and undeviatingly been
guided by Lenin’s teachings on the party.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">Lenin taught us that a line based on principle is the only
correct line. Never to deviate a single step in anything from
the interests of the party....</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">We must be guided by these wise injunctions of Lenin in all
our activity.</p>

</div>

<p>In April, 1956, a Moscow journal, <i>International Affairs</i>, also
made clear the pre-eminence of Leninism in Russia:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Using the brilliant plan left by Lenin.... All the complex
questions of home and foreign policy are decided by the Party,
basing itself on the teaching of the immortal Lenin. That is
why the Soviet people recall the words of Vladimir Mayakovsky
[Soviet poet]:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These sentiments have been echoed by communists in the
United States. In January, 1957, for example, Eugene Dennis,
former General Secretary of the Communist Party, USA,
wrote, “... it is essential at all costs to consolidate and build
the CPUSA as a strong Marxist-Leninist political party of the
working class.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>Another American Party leader, Hyman Lumer, stated in
February, 1957:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... he [Lenin] showed ... the need for a vanguard type of
party, armed with the Marxist theory of scientific socialism
and possessing a high degree of unity and discipline.... In
its essential features, this is no less true today than it was
when Lenin first formulated it.</p>

</div>

<p>Lenin could not have anticipated the lofty pedestal on
which he was to stand in Moscow a generation after his death.
However, his nation and the Party were to pass under the
control of an ambitious, scowling, mustached revolutionary
from the province of Georgia in south Russia, Joseph Stalin,
who until recently was regarded as the fourth great personality
of communism.</p>

<div class="chapter box2b">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_3">3.<br>
<i>Stalin—A Fallen Idol</i></h3>

</div>

<p>In January, 1924, after a long illness, Lenin died, leaving
open a struggle for power that was to last until the 1930’s.</p>

<p>The Russian dictator sensed, some time before his death,
the evil influence of the man who had squirmed his way to
the position of the Party’s General Secretary. Joseph Stalin,
a cobbler’s son, had been an old-time Bolshevik. Born in
1879, he had attended a seminary at Tiflis, in the Caucasus,
but in 1899 had been expelled. Already he was involved in
revolutionary activities. From 1902 until 1913, according to
the communists, he was arrested seven times, exiled six times,
and escaped five times from exile.</p>

<p>Plodding by nature, Stalin lacked the brilliance of his chief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
rival, Leon Trotsky. However, his grasp of the Russian mentality
was tremendous. Years as an agitator, prison inmate,
and political schemer gave him an insight into communist
intrigue that other Party leaders seemed to lack. Working
silently but meticulously, he was quick to exploit any opportunity
to increase his personal power.</p>

<p>Stalin liked to represent himself as the heir of Lenin, the
man predestined to carry on the Bolshevik revolution. This
claim is not borne out, however, by a “testament” prepared by
Lenin shortly before his death. “Comrade Stalin,” wrote Lenin,
on Christmas Day, 1922, “having become General Secretary,
has concentrated an enormous power in his hands; and I am
not sure that he always knows how to use that power with
sufficient caution.”</p>

<p>Then Lenin added a postscript dated January 4, 1923, a
full year before he died:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Stalin is too rude, and this fault, entirely supportable in
relations among us Communists, becomes insupportable in the
office of General Secretary. Therefore, I propose to the comrades
to find a way to remove Stalin from that position....</p>

</div>

<p>However, the time for action had passed. Lenin was too
sick to implement his testament. The result: a terrific struggle
between Stalin and Trotsky for power.</p>

<p>Trotsky (real name Bronstein) was born in 1879 (two
months earlier than Stalin). Early a revolutionary, he spent
many years as an exile from Russia. After the Bolshevik revolution
he served as Lenin’s Commissar of Foreign Affairs and
later did much to organize the Red army.</p>

<p>Many differences separated Stalin and Trotsky, the chief
one being Stalin’s idea that Russia should concentrate on
making itself powerful <i>first</i>, before undertaking extensive
revolutionary action abroad. Trotsky, on the other hand, believed
that the Russian revolution could survive only if communist
revolutions were promoted in other countries. Both
desired world conquest. Their dispute, clouded by a personal
hunger for power, centered on how to achieve it. Stalin was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
the winner. Trotsky was exiled by Stalin in 1929, eventually
finding refuge in Mexico. He was assassinated in 1940, reportedly
by a secret communist agent.</p>

<p>Joseph Stalin was the fourth “top leader” of communism,
claiming “divine” ancestry from Marx, Engels, and Lenin.
Until his death in 1953, Stalin played a major role in the history
of Russian and world communism, as a “continuer” of the
work of Lenin. It was Stalin who, through murder, deceit,
and brutality, gave communism <i>power</i>, firmly establishing Bolshevik
control in Russia and spreading communism to other
countries. However, he also was to become the first of the
“Big Four” to be denounced by the communists and to have
his name blackened by successors.</p>

<p>In carrying on the revolution Stalin became the interpreter
of Marxism-Leninism. Under his rule the state, which Marx
had visualized as “withering away,” became even stronger, an
agent of sheer oppression. The army, navy, secret police, and
all political structures of the state grew ever more powerful
and permanent. Slave labor camps multiplied. Soviet society
became ironclad, more rigid than under the most autocratic
Czar. Army officials, Party henchmen, industrial managers, all
emerged as classes, each jealous of the other. The “workingman,”
whom Marx had extolled, was now an inferior class,
exploited and downtrodden.</p>

<p>Stalin carried to the extreme Lenin’s concepts of the Party
as a fanatical, disciplined group. To Stalin the Party was not
only a tool to seize and maintain power but also a method of
liquidating all personal opposition and a means of educating
the masses in the communist way of life.</p>

<p>The Party, for this reason, was kept “pure,” meaning completely
loyal, disciplined, and blindly obedient. Party schools,
cadre training, and regimented discipline were needed to
saturate the members in communism. Weaklings were purged,
expelled and exiled to Siberia, or executed. In Soviet Russia,
and all her satellites, the Party was constantly “Bolshevized”—made
“more perfect in communism.”</p>

<p>One result of this insistent demand for discipline under
Stalin was the increasing crystallization of Marxism-Leninism—already<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
a harsh and regimented code—into an even more
rigid, static, and often sterile body of doctrine. Like a shrinking
garment, communist doctrine pressed ever more tightly on
communists everywhere. Every action now had to be “justified”
by theory. If the theory didn’t fit, then it had to be reinterpreted.
To deviate was to court disaster. Stalin, though not
so good a theorist as Lenin, liked to pose as Marxism-Leninism’s
“expert” interpreter.</p>

<p>This ossification of communist doctrine, under which the
individual was afraid to take any initiative, contributed largely
to the violent reaction against Stalin after his death. His successors
realized that <i>some</i> breathing room was absolutely
essential, although during Stalin’s reign they were content to
serve, without protest so far as the record shows, as the executors
of his policies.</p>

<p>Stalin also identified communism with nationalism and
imperialism: <i>Russian</i> nationalism and <i>Russian</i> imperialism.</p>

<p>To him, communism seemed an ideal vehicle for Russian
world conquest, and so, once communism was firmly entrenched
in Russia, he embarked on a policy curiously similar
to that of Czarist imperialists like Peter the Great and Catherine
the Great.</p>

<p>Aided by disturbed world conditions between 1939 and
1953, Stalin started the Soviet chariot of conquest. He directly
annexed a number of areas, such as eastern Poland,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, part of Finland, eastern Czechoslovakia,
part of Roumania. Then, using communism as an
ideological adhesive, Stalin created a Soviet orbit: Yugoslavia,
China, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, North Korea, Czechoslovakia,
Roumania, East Germany, Albania, Tibet, Outer Mongolia,
and North Indochina (where bloody fighting was in
progress at the time of his death). No wonder William Z.
Foster in February, 1956, could boast that seventeen countries
were “actually building Socialism or are definitely orientating
in that direction,” having a total population of 900,000,000!
He adds: “They constitute the beginning of the new Socialist
world.” Note the use of the word “beginning.”</p>

<p>Native communist parties, aided by Moscow, were often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
the instruments of subjugation, Trojan horses of the twentieth
century. At other times Russian military power paved the way.
Peoples with long traditions of freedom were betrayed into
slavery. Significantly, no entire country has ever gone communist
and become a satellite by the free choice of election.</p>

<p>This grandiose conquest was abetted by Stalin’s inheritance
of the tools of Marxism-Leninism, a way of life that is imperialistic,
overbearing, and dictatorial. Some individuals
may accuse Stalin, alone of the communist “Big Four,” of being
responsible for the terror of modern-day communism.
Marx, Engels, and Lenin, however, are also fully accountable,
and so are Stalin’s henchmen, who still rule in the Soviet
Union. Stalin may have been the active agent of conquest in
our generation, but his knives were sharpened on the diabolical
teachings of his communist predecessors.</p>

<p>Even in Stalin’s time cracks had begun to appear in the
communist empire. In 1948 a terrific fissure, the break with
Tito’s Yugoslavia, rocked Moscow. Currents of discontent,
leading to national communism, spread through the European
satellite nations. (National communism holds that nations can
find their own way to communism and need not slavishly
copy Moscow, yet also implies full confidence in the aims and
doctrines of Marxism-Leninism, whose application will result
in world communism.) “Treason trials” sprouted in many
places: Vladimir Clementis and Rudolf Slansky in Czechoslovakia;
Laszlo Rajk in Hungary; Traicho Kostov in Bulgaria.
These high Party officials, all old-time communists, along
with others, were executed. In Poland, Wladyslaw Gomulka,
a deputy premier, was expelled from the Party and imprisoned.
Stalin’s tyranny became even more strongly entrenched.</p>

<p>Few observers, even in Russia, however, could have guessed
the intensity of hatred that lay under Russian tyranny. Less
than four years after Stalin’s death the power of freedom was
to erupt in Hungary. Poland swayed on the verge of revolt;
unrest swept other satellites. Ironically, Gomulka, expelled as
a traitor, now became Party boss of Poland; Rajk, along with
others, was “rehabilitated.” The “sorrowing” communists even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
dug up his body, staged a giant funeral, and buried him again,
this time with honors. Stalin left a precarious legacy for his
successors.</p>

<p>But in barely a generation Russia had moved swiftly forward
in its campaign of world conquest. In the name of Karl
Marx (who, in his day, had roundly denounced the imperialism
of the Czars) and by the application of his doctrines,
Stalin had created a dictatorial empire far beyond the dreams
of any Czar. Such a dictatorial empire grows out of the very
nature of Marxist thought and is inevitable wherever it is
applied. In the Kremlin the dream of world conquest still persists.
It threatens free peoples everywhere.</p>

<p>This Russian conquest was made possible, in large measure,
by the tremendous strengthening of the Soviet state. In 1928
the first of a series of Five Year Plans, designed to strengthen
heavy industry and collectivize agriculture, was launched.
Step by step the New Economic Policy, adopted by Lenin in
1921, disappeared.</p>

<p>The government now undertook to control everything.
Production quotas, which had to be met, were set. Compulsory
labor increased. Private trade disappeared. A system of rationing
was introduced. Consumer goods virtually disappeared.</p>

<p>In rural areas small farms were abolished. Peasants were
compelled to live in giant cooperatives. Many of the more
well-to-do farmers, called kulaks, were dispossessed and
shipped to Siberia. Entire families were liquidated. The secret
police became more active.</p>

<p>As under Lenin’s “war communism,” the Five Year Plan
brought untold human misery. The forced collectivization of
agriculture caused a shortage of food. Transportation broke
down in many areas. In the Ukraine, the food basket of Russia,
famine reappeared. Millions of people died. Disease
stalked the land.</p>

<p>But Stalin held firm. Heavy industry must be expanded—steel
mills, automobile and tractor factories, railroads. Coal
mines must be operated. Armaments must be expedited.
Stalin was preparing the base for world conquest. The price in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
human suffering and privation was incalculable, and unimportant.</p>

<p>At the same time Stalin was furthering a communist society.
Art, literature, education, and the press were harnessed to the
struggle. A new generation dedicated to following Stalin’s
will was being created. No opposition was tolerated. In 1936
Stalin brought forth a Soviet constitution, a document glittering
with supposed “rights” for the people but actually a
mask for ever-increasing tyranny.</p>

<p>From 1934 to 1938 was a period of great purges. The world
witnessed the spectacle of gigantic public trials of old Bolsheviks
such as Grigori Zinoviev and Nikolai Bukharin, both
former presidents of the Communist International, and A. I.
Rykov, a former Premier, all accused of treason. Even Yagoda,
former head of the secret police, was brought to court. Many,
as comrades of Lenin, had fought to create the Bolshevik
revolution. Now they were denounced as arch traitors. Nobody
knows how many thousands were killed in these blood
purges. But one thing was obvious: Stalin was liquidating all
possible opposition.</p>

<p>Inevitably Stalin became, in communist eyes, a virtual god
on earth. He was pictured as the world’s greatest military
genius, scientist, author, critic, statesman, popular hero,
thinker and engineer.</p>

<p>Here are some of the accolades:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Long live the wise leader of our Party and people, the inspirer
and organizer of all our victories, Comrade Stalin! (N.
S. Khrushchev, October, 1952)</p>

<p>... Stalin’s work will live through the ages, and grateful
posterity will, like us, glorify his name. (G. M. Malenkov,
March, 1953, who in 1957 was junked like Stalin)</p>

<p>... During those hard and grim days for our Motherland,
the greatness of our leader and teacher, Comrade Stalin, was
revealed in all its magnificence. (N. A. Bulganin, December,
1949)</p>

</div>

<p>On March 5, 1953, Stalin died. The communist world went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
into mourning. His funeral was a state spectacle. His body,
like Lenin’s, was entombed in Moscow. Speeches extolled his
“greatness.”</p>

<p>The whole world wondered, What next? First a triumvirate,
Malenkov, Molotov, and Beria, assumed control. Less
than a year later Beria, head of the secret police, was executed
as a “traitor.” Then Malenkov, generally regarded as
the Number One leader, was deposed as Premier. Later,
Molotov, the old-time Bolshevik, was ousted from the Foreign
Ministry, as was his successor, Dmitri T. Shepilov, former
editor of <i>Pravda</i>. All three were denounced in 1957 as “enemies”
of the Party. (Still later, Marshal Georgi Zhukov, Red
Army hero, was ousted as Soviet Defense Minister.)</p>

<p>Gradually new faces began to appear, especially that of
Nikita S. Khrushchev, a Politburo member, who became First
Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party,
a powerful position. N. A. Bulganin, one of Stalin’s “political”
generals, assumed the job of Premier. These two, referred to
as “B and K,” became the most prominently known leaders.</p>

<p>Significant changes, both in foreign and domestic policies,
appeared. But underneath, as the suppression of the Hungarian
revolt was to prove, lay the ruthless policies of Stalin.
Under Malenkov, attempts were made to encourage the production
of consumer items, but with his fall, stress reverted
to the old Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry. In the foreign
field, “B and K” made a widely heralded trip to Yugoslavia,
there to woo Tito back into the Moscow camp. The “Big
Smile” was radiant at the Geneva Conference of July, 1955,
attended by heads of state of France, England, the United
States, and Russia, and during highly publicized visits of “B
and K” to India and Great Britain.</p>

<p>The cult of Stalin, which had reached nauseating proportions,
was toned down. Emphasis was laid on collective leadership.
Then, on the night of February 24-25, 1956, came
the bombshell that shook and shocked communists around the
world—the bitter denunciation of Stalin by Khrushchev at the
Twentieth Congress of the Russian Communist Party. It was
as devastating a speech as was ever delivered by one man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
against another. Copies of the speech, not made public in
Russia, found their way to the West and in June, 1956, were
released by our own Department of State.</p>

<p>Khrushchev denounced Stalin, the “great Stalin” who had
been idolized by all communists as a man who could do no
wrong, as a murderer, pathological liar, and perverter of
Marxism-Leninism. In fiery language and with specific names
and dates, Khrushchev accused Stalin of mass terror, deporting
whole populations, forging false evidence against alleged
enemies, being a coward during World War II, and possessing
a vanity that led him to believe he was a god. Khrushchev
in his systematic destruction of Stalin dealt with such matters
as:</p>

<p><i>1. Mass terror:</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Stalin acted not through persuasion, explanation, and patient
cooperation with people, but by imposing his concepts and
demanding absolute submission to his opinion. Whoever opposed
this concept or tried to prove his viewpoint, and the
correctness of his position—was doomed to ... subsequent
moral and physical annihilation.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>Stalin put the Party and the NKVD [secret police] up to the
use of mass terror....</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>Mass arrests of Party, Soviet, economic and military workers
caused tremendous harm to our country and to the cause of
Socialist advancement.</p>

</div>

<p><i>2. Suspicion and distrust:</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Stalin was a very distrustful man, sickly suspicious; we
knew this from our work with him. He could look at a man
and say: “Why are your eyes so shifty today,” or “Why are
you turning so much today and avoiding to look me directly
in the eyes?” The sickly suspicion created in him a general<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
distrust even toward eminent Party workers whom he had
known for years. Everywhere and in everything he saw “enemies,”
“two-facers” and “spies.”</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>“It has happened sometimes that a man goes to Stalin on
his invitation as a friend. And when he sits with Stalin, he does
not know where he will be sent next, home or to jail.”</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">... after the war ... Stalin became even more capricious,
irritable and brutal; in particular his suspicion grew. His persecution
mania reached unbelievable dimensions. Many
workers were becoming enemies before his very eyes. After
the war Stalin separated himself from the collective even more.
Everything was decided by him alone without any consideration
for anyone or anything.</p>

</div>

<p><i>3. Illegal arrests:</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>[In one case, Stalin curtly told an official:] “If you do not
obtain confessions from the doctors we will shorten you by a
head.”</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>When Stalin said that one or another should be arrested,
it was necessary to accept on faith that he was an “enemy of
the people”.... And how is it possible that a person confesses
to crimes which he has not committed? Only in one way—because
of application of physical methods of pressuring him,
tortures, bringing him to a state of unconsciousness, deprivation
of his judgment, taking away of his human dignity. In this
manner were “confessions” acquired.</p>

</div>

<p><i>4. Abuse of power:</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is clear that here Stalin showed in a whole series of cases
his intolerance, his brutality and his abuse of power. Instead
of proving his political correctness and mobilizing the masses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
he often chose the path of repression and physical annihilation,
not only against actual enemies, but also against individuals
who had not committed any crimes against the Party
and the Soviet government.</p>

</div>

<p><i>5. Isolation from people:</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Stalin separated himself from the people and never went
anywhere. This lasted tens of years. The last time he visited a
village was in January 1928 when he visited Siberia in connection
with grain deliveries. How then could he have known
the situation in the provinces?</p>

</div>

<p><i>6. Love of self:</i></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>You should have seen Stalin’s fury! How could it be admitted
that he, Stalin, had not been right! He is after all a
“genius,” and a genius cannot help but be right! Everyone
can err, but Stalin considered that he never erred, that he was
always right. He never acknowledged to anyone that he made
any mistake, large or small, despite the fact that he made not
a few mistakes in the matter of theory and in his practical
activity.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>The cult of the individual acquired such monstrous size
chiefly because Stalin himself, using all conceivable methods,
supported the glorification of his own person....</p>

</div>

<p>Khrushchev, telling how Stalin, in his own hand, wrote
flattering statements about himself for his own biography,
said: “This book is an expression of the most dissolute flattery,
an example of making a man into a godhead, of transforming
him into an infallible sage, ‘the greatest leader,’ ‘sublime
strategist of all times and nations.’ Finally no other words
could be found with which to lift Stalin up to the heavens.”</p>

<p>And then Khrushchev says, Stalin even had the audacity to
add, again with his own pen, “... Stalin never allowed his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
work to be marred by the slightest hint of vanity, conceit or
self-adulation.”</p>

<p>No mention was made by Khrushchev of any anti-Semitic
crimes committed by Stalin. However, on April 4, 1956, an
article entitled “Our Pain and Our Solace” appeared in the
Warsaw Yiddish-language newspaper <i>Folks-Shtimme</i>, which
charged that Jewish culture had been largely liquidated under
Stalin and many Jewish leaders executed. To date these allegations
have never been denied by the Kremlin and American
communists have reluctantly accepted them as true. On April
13, 1956, the East Coast communist paper, the <i>Daily Worker</i>,
in an editorial entitled “Grievous Deeds,” made mention of
the earlier Polish “disclosures ... that a large number of Jewish
writers and other Jewish leaders were framed up and executed
and that Jewish culture was virtually wiped out” in the
Soviet Union. These monstrous deeds of anti-Semitism in
Russia have had profound repercussions among communists
in the United States.</p>

<p>No single event in Party history so unnerved communists
abroad—and inside Russia too—as did the Khrushchev attack.
Where did it leave communist leaders who year after year had
fawned upon Stalin as the greatest of all leaders? Weren’t
they also responsible for such terrible perversions? What was
this system called communism, represented as noble, when
its chief exponent was a murderer, falsifier, and bigot?</p>

<p>History alone can tell the reasons for, and the ultimate
effects of, this violent denunciation. We know about the growing
unrest within Russia and the eagerness of the government
to appease demands for a higher standard of living. We
know how communists like to find scapegoats on whom they
can place the people’s hate and distrust, especially if the
scapegoat is dead. We know of the jealous jockeying for power
that is inevitable in any communist hierarchy.</p>

<p>Moreover, there also appeared to be an effort to rid communism
of the growing “dead hand” of Stalin who, in his old
age, had become capriciously tyrannical and personally maniacal.
His successors saw how this crust of sludge, through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
fear, terror, and ossification of communist doctrine, was crushing
initiative.</p>

<p>But the essential elements of Stalinism, brutality, illegality,
ruthlessness, remain. In October, 1956, the Hungarians revolted
against their puppet government, only to be violently
attacked by Soviet tanks and troops. Nothing could illustrate
better the unrepentant Soviet heart. Moscow still firmly controls
her satellite empire. Nowhere in a communist country
have truly free elections been held. Communist subversion
against the free world continues. Atheism remains a dominant
doctrine. Unremitting support for Moscow is still demanded
of communists everywhere. Speaking before the East German
Parliament, Khrushchev made this point clear by stressing the
“holy duty” of every communist to help strengthen the communist
world.</p>

<p>Apparently realizing he had gone too far in criticizing Stalin,
Khrushchev backed up and started to praise the late dictator,
showing that in actual fact Khrushchevism was actually Stalinism
in a different dress. At a diplomatic reception in Moscow
in early 1957, Khrushchev commented boldly:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">As a Communist fighting for the interest of the working class,
Stalin was a model Communist.... We have criticized Stalin,
we still criticize him, and if necessary we will do it again.
But we do not criticize Stalin as a bad Communist as far as
the interests of the working classes are concerned.... God
grant that every Communist should fight for the interest of the
working class as Stalin did.</p>

</div>

<p>What can we expect in the future? Let Khrushchev himself
answer: “Those who expect us to abandon communism will
have to wait until a shrimp learns to whistle.”</p>

<p>“What will the [Soviet] policy be like?... We will do the
same, but with more emphasis.”</p>

<p>This is the enemy we face today.</p>

<i>How U.S. Communism Began, 1919-21</i></h3>

</div>

<p>The world-wide dangers of the communist conspiracy
started with the Russian revolution in 1917. There and then,
for the first time, a communist party seized control of a nation.
Almost immediately this conspiracy spread to the United
States, seeking to take root by undermining our institutions
and traditions.</p>

<p>The Communist Party, USA, first emerged in Chicago, Illinois,
in 1919. In the beginning it seemed little more than a
freak. Yet in the intervening years that freak has grown into
a powerful monster endangering us all. Here is the story:</p>

<p>An emergency convention of the Socialist Party was scheduled
to begin in Machinists’ Hall, 113 South Ashland Boulevard,
Chicago, on August 30, 1919. The air was charged with
tension. The socialists were badly split. The left wing, thrilled
by the Russian October Revolution, wanted to establish a
Communist Party. The rightists opposed.</p>

<p>The procommunist left-wingers, however, could not agree
on a program of action. One group wanted to use the emergency
convention to take over the Socialist Party. Another
group objected, wanting to set up a Communist Party right
away.</p>

<p>A battle quickly developed. Men famous in the history of
American communism—Benjamin Gitlow, John Reed, Charles
Ruthenberg, Alfred Wagenknecht—were present. Each was
trying to assemble followers for his point of view.</p>

<p>One group, the Reed-Gitlow group, refused entrance to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Socialist Convention, retired to another room in Machinists’
Hall (later to the IWW Hall, 129 Throop Street), and on
August 31, 1919, founded the <i>Communist Labor Party of
America</i> (CLP). Wagenknecht was named Executive Secretary.
(John Reed, incidentally, was to become the Party’s first
“martyr.” An American, well-educated, a poet, writer and
newspaperman, Reed was in Russia during the October Revolution.
Completely captivated, he wrote a book, <i>Ten Days
That Shook the World</i>. He later returned to Moscow, participated
in Comintern meetings, and died there in 1920. Reed
was buried in the Kremlin.)</p>

<p>A rival group, together with a number of foreign-language
federations, met at Smolny Hall, headquarters of the Russian
Federation, 1221 Blue Island Avenue, Chicago. Its members
criticized the Communist Labor Party as not being truly communistic.
The CLP returned the retort, and all attempts at
reconciliation failed. On September 1, 1919, this rival group
formed the <i>Communist Party of America</i> (CP). Split off was
a group from Michigan that was later to form the Proletarian
Party. Ruthenberg was chosen as Executive Secretary of the
CP.</p>

<p>Not one but two Parties, the CLP and the CP, each claiming
to be the true representative of communism and bitterly
maligning the other, came out of the Chicago turmoil. The
CLP set up headquarters in Cleveland, the CP in Chicago.
The Communist Party was born in America amid confusion,
bickering, and partisanship, a condition that was to haunt it
for years.</p>

<p>The communists of 1919 were a motley lot, vastly different
from the highly disciplined, efficiently operating Party of recent
years. Though not lacking zeal or fanaticism, they had
little Party training or discipline. They varied in extremes
from bitter die-hards, who were ready to do anything for the
“cause,” even throw a bomb or lead a riot, to comical show-offs,
attracted by violent language and subversive possibilities.
Many believed revolution in the United States was imminent.</p>

<p>The great majority were foreign-born. Many had difficulty
speaking English. <i>The Communist</i> (June 12, 1920) states:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
“The Communist Party, from the very beginning of its existence,
found its work hampered because it had in its ranks only
a few men capable of expressing Communist principles in the
English language.” The comrades lacked a practical understanding
of American affairs, especially in the trade union
field. Soon all kinds of wild-eyed plans arose. Each leader
became his own interpreter of Marx and Lenin. Cliques, quarrels,
and personal rivalries were rife.</p>

<p>The Russians (those who had been born in the “home of
the revolution”) thought they should play the predominant
role. They argued: Wasn’t Lenin a Russian? Didn’t the revolution
start in Russia? Hence they, the Russian-born, obviously
had an “insight” denied all the others. They should be the
leaders.</p>

<p>On one point, however, all agreed: obedience to Soviet
Russia. Every communist considered Lenin a god and the
Russian Bolsheviks models of perfection. These were the men
who had made the October Revolution. They were the
teachers; the Americans, the learners. Soviet Russia, at this
time, was assuming an authority over communists in this
nation that it has never relinquished. This control was to become
ever more pronounced, inescapable, and dangerous.</p>

<p>The history of the Communist Party in the United States
since 1919 is characterized by two main trends: (1) the
development of a disciplined Party structure or, in the words
of William Z. Foster, “the building of a Leninist Party of a
new type,” and (2) the complete and unquestioning subservience
of the Party to Soviet Russia. Every word and deed,
hope and aspiration, of American communists over the years
has promoted these two objectives.</p>

<p>The conventions of the CLP and CP were over, but “civil
war” continued. Communists roamed the country, denouncing
each other.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks after the Chicago conventions Charles
Ruthenberg, Executive Secretary of the Communist Party (the
“American Lenin,” who died in 1927 and whose ashes lie
buried in the Kremlin), mounted a platform in Minneapolis,
Minnesota.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span></p>

<p>He began his address. The Communist Party was the heir
of the revolutionary spirit and its rival, the Communist Labor
Party, was wrong. The CLP, he charged, was “centrist,” a
vile word to communists, just like the Party in Germany
where the communists had failed. But <i>his</i> group, the Communist
Party, was without sin. It represented the thoughts of
the victorious Bolshevik Party of Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>When would the revolution come? Ruthenberg did not
know; tomorrow or next week. But he was optimistic. The
communists, he said, had better hurry to learn how to run the
government.</p>

<p>Communist Labor Party orators replied in kind. They denounced
their opponents. They alone held the sacred communist
truth. Splinter factions, and they were many, raised
their voices. They attacked everybody but themselves. American
communism in these early days was bedlam.</p>

<p>There were other complications. Just a few weeks after the
founding conventions, in the fall of 1919, the federal government
and local authorities initiated prosecutive action against
the communists.</p>

<p>As a consequence the communist movement went underground.
Comrades met in secret hide-outs, maintained underground
headquarters, and sent messages by couriers. Hidden
printing presses poured out propaganda.</p>

<p>Underground or not, the “civil war” continued. The
cramped quarters did not hinder the oratorical artillery. The
inter-Party strife became fantastically bitter.</p>

<p>Moscow did not like either this bickering or the enforced
underground work. The Kremlin wanted a single, unified
Party, able to operate legally (above ground) as well as illegally
(underground). Communism simply could not thrive
on factional fights or in stuffy undercover cellars.</p>

<p>Moscow intervened through the Third International, an
organization designed by the Soviets to control Communist
Parties in other nations and to serve as an instrument of
world revolution. The founding Congress of the Comintern,
which opened March 2, 1919, in the Kremlin, was a bizarre
affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>The “delegates” were chiefly make-believe, picked from
prisoners of war, visitors in Moscow, or “rubber-stamp”
friends. The main problem was to find as many nationalities
as possible. This was an “international” organization. That
these individuals were not truly representative of their “home”
groups did not matter. England was “represented” by a Russian
emigré; Hungary by a prisoner of war.</p>

<p>The proceedings were impromptu. It is related that Lenin,
during one session, sent Angelica Balabanoff (later to become
General Secretary of the Comintern) a note on a scrap of
paper instructing her to take the floor and announce the
affiliation of the Italian Socialist Party with the International.
She replied that she could not. She had not been in contact
with Italian Socialists. They were “loyal.” There was no doubt
of that, but she could not speak for them.</p>

<p>Lenin’s answer was prompt, scribbled in another note:
“You read <i>Avanti</i> [their newspaper] and you know what is
going on in Italy.”</p>

<p>The Comintern soon became a powerful weapon of communist
control. The Second World Congress of the Communist
International, held in Russia during July-August, 1920,
adopted the notorious twenty-one points of admission for
Comintern membership. These were basic rules that every
Communist Party must accept before being admitted. The
twenty-one points established an ironclad discipline, a single
type of Party structure from which there could be no dissent.
Here are some of the conditions:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—All party publications must have communist editors.</p>

<p class="hanging">—If communists cannot carry out their work legally, “a combination
of legal and illegal work is absolutely necessary.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—Vigorous and systematic communist propaganda must be
carried on in the army. If forbidden by law, it must be pursued
illegally.</p>

<p class="hanging">—Each Communist Party must develop communist agitation in
rural areas, within trade unions, workers’ councils, and other
mass organizations.</p>

<p class="hanging">—“Parties belonging to the Communist International must be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
built upon the principle of democratic centralism,” that is,
“organized in the most centralized manner,” controlled by
“iron discipline,” and with a leadership possessing power and
authority.</p>

<p class="hanging">—Parties operating legally must “make periodical cleanings” of
the membership to weed out dissenters.</p>

<p class="hanging">—“Every party that desires to belong to the Communist International
must give every possible support to the Soviet Republics
in their struggle against all counter-revolutionary
forces.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—“All decisions of the Congresses of the Communist International,
as well as the decisions of its Executive Committee,
are binding on all parties affiliated to the Communist International.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here is the final, clinching point:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—“Members of the Party who reject the conditions and theses
of the Communist International, on principle, must be expelled
from the party.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Comintern made its position clear: either join on its
terms, involving complete surrender, or become a renegade.
Later congresses elaborated on this communist discipline. In
July, 1921, for example, an order was issued by the Comintern
Executive Committee that national congresses were to be held
after the Comintern congresses so that they could ratify
decisions. The Fourth Congress (1922) ruled that all Comintern
delegates should arrive in Moscow uninstructed. Lenin
was determined to make the Comintern the iron fist that controlled
communism throughout the world.</p>

<p>The Third International exercised supervision not only by
instructing American communists who flocked to Moscow but
by sending representatives, or “reps” as they were called, to
this country. These individuals would openly sit in communist
meetings, participate in decisions, and issue orders. The
“reps” represented Moscow, and that fact alone was proof of
their communist “divinity.”</p>

<p>The Comintern “reps” contributed to a picturesque period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
in the history of American communism. Many were riffraff
European Bolsheviks, of various nationalities, themselves
knowing little about communism, who were hurriedly dispatched
to the United States. Often, by their inept actions,
they made American leaders more confused than ever. To gain
admittance to the United States, they often used fake names,
false passports, and special “covers.”</p>

<p>This sounds like a crude system, and, in the light of present-day
communist “diplomacy,” it was. Nobody would imagine
an official Soviet representative so identified in today’s communist
meetings or American communists openly going to
Moscow to receive instructions. This “crudity” has been
polished. The same channels of communication are still open,
but more “professional” ways of supervision have been perfected.</p>

<p>Soon after the 1919 founding conventions, the Executive
Committee of the Communist International sent a letter to
the two underground Parties, the CP and CLP. The split, said
the Comintern, had harmed the communist cause in the
United States. Unity must be established “in the shortest possible
time.” The letter recommended the calling of a joint
convention. The condition for unity was acceptance of the
program of the Comintern.</p>

<p>This meant that personalities must be submerged, cliques
ousted, and a uniform, standardized structure instituted. The
concepts of a small, tightly knit Party (as taught by Lenin)
must be put into practice. The Russian mentality must be imposed
on <i>every</i> Party member. The Comintern was emphatic:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... unity is not only possible, but absolutely necessary. The
Executive Committee categorically insists on its immediate
realization.</p>

</div>

<p>In May, 1920, a “unity” convention of the Communist Labor
Party and a faction (led by Ruthenberg) of the Communist
Party was secretly held at Bridgman, Michigan, resulting in
the formation of the United Communist Party of America
(UCP). The delegates, as a security measure, used assumed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
names. <i>The Communist</i>, in a special convention issue, was
secretive: “Sometime recently, somewhere between the Atlantic
and Pacific, between the Gulf and the Great Lakes, two
groups of elected delegates assembled as the Unity Conference
of the Communist Party and the Communist Labor Party.” A
Comintern “rep” was present.</p>

<p>Many elements of the Communist Party, however, refused
to go along and boycotted the new UCP. A chief point of dispute
between the CP and CLP was the position of the foreign-language
federations: should they be autonomous within the
Party, having the right, if they desired, to withdraw, or be
completely subject to the will of the Party? This issue touched
the very heart of communist doctrine. No Communist Party
could ever allow a member the “right” to withdraw. The misguided
members seeking to retain some of these “rights” were
swimming upstream, destined to failure.</p>

<p>Finally in May, 1921, after another year of bickering, the
UCP and the remainder of the CP formed the Communist
Party of America, Section of the Communist International, at
a secret two-week convention at Woodstock, New York. The
group’s program, among other things, provided that the Communist
Party would work for violent revolution, preparing
“the workers for armed insurrection as the only means of
overthrowing the capitalist state.” The convention officially
accepted the twenty-one points for admission to the Comintern.
The CP was now a complete prisoner of Moscow.</p>

<p>By early 1921 an “outward” unity was achieved in the communist
movement, but the second problem still remained:
bringing the Party into the open. The Third Congress of the
Comintern (June-July, 1921) defined the problem:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The Communist International draws the attention of the Communist
Party of America (unified) to the fact that the illegalized
organization must not only serve as the ground for collecting
and crystallizing the active Communist forces, but
that it is the Party’s duty to try all ways and means to get out
of the illegalized condition into the open, among the wide
masses.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span></p>

<p>The outline of the Party of today was beginning to take
shape, the true Party conceived by Lenin, having both a legal
and illegal apparatus. The legal aspect would be necessary to
conduct communist propaganda among the noncommunist
masses, to infiltrate organizations and operate communist
fronts. But the underground must exist, for the revolution, the
final aim of the Party, could never be anything but illegal.
The underground apparatus would handle espionage, super-secret
Party work, and would always be ready to expand if
the legal Party, because of “capitalist” opposition, could
not operate fully. The Communist Party at all times has desired
both an upper and a lower level.</p>

<p>In December, 1921, the Workers Party of America was
formed, a “legal” outlet for the underground Communist
Party. The founding convention, held in New York City, was
organized, controlled, and directed by Party leaders. Acting
as a front for the underground communists, the Workers
Party set up “open” headquarters, issued a “public” paper,
and operated in full view. The communist movement now
had a dual setup: the underground Communist Party, affiliated
with the Third International in Moscow, commonly
known among members as <i>Number One</i>, and the Workers
Party, not so affiliated, known as <i>Number Two</i>. They were,
however, the two faces of the same communist coin.</p>

<p>Those were turbulent days in the American communist
movement. Party leaders were grotesque characters, making
speeches in underground meetings, sitting in secret conventions
(sometimes in the middle of woods), or traveling to
Moscow. They usually had several aliases for use on fake
passports and in Party correspondence or to be given to the
police if arrested.</p>

<p>Their obsessive love was Soviet Russia. Communists of all
varieties streamed to Moscow. William Z. Foster, Earl
Browder, Jay Lovestone, Benjamin Gitlow, John Reed,
“Mother” Bloor visited there. Many had business: to attend
Comintern meetings, to serve as “representatives” of the
American Party, to enroll in a communist school. Others went
as plain sight-seers, to view at first hand this land of “paradise.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
Sometimes whole groups would go, as for example
a delegation that sailed in 1927 to celebrate the tenth anniversary
of the revolution.</p>

<p>The visitors were received cordially and treated well unless
reason existed to the contrary. Some actually got to see
the great Lenin. William Z. Foster, telling of seeing Lenin
for the first time in 1921, commented that “It was one of
the most inspiring moments” of his life. They attended Comintern
Congresses, talked to high Party officials, looked
around the town. They were being primed for their roles,
puppets to fight the communist battle in America.</p>

<p>Then back they came to tell their comrades of the marvels
of this new land. In speeches all over the country they
shouted communist propaganda:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Russia is the only “real democracy” on earth; the working
people are better off in Russia than in America.</p>

</div>

<p>Never has the American communist movement expressed
itself in more revolutionary, violent, and bitter terms than in
the early 1920’s. Party leaders shunned the cautious, evasive
double talk of today’s communists. They believed in violent
revolution and said so. The underground communist press
was filled with revolutionary statements. One journal tried to
outdo the other in the use of violent language.</p>

<p>The Party was controlled, just as it is today, by a very few.
Moreover, policy, at all times, was subject to the approval of
the Kremlin, acting through the Comintern. Loyal Americans
should always remember that the Communist Party, USA,
has never existed as an independent organization. Soviet
control was instituted at the very beginning. Acceptance of
the twenty-one points confirmed the imprisonment.</p>

<p>Party business of the underground apparatus and the above-ground
Workers Party was supervised by the Secretariat, a
group usually consisting of three of the most trusted leaders.
A larger group, the Political Committee of some seven to
ten comrades, handled many of the Party’s day-to-day affairs,
such as manipulating a strike, designating a new Party<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
official, planning infiltration tactics. The Secretariat, elected
by the Political Committee, however, handled the most confidential
matters, items not even brought to the attention of
the Political Committee: the safeguarding of records, receipt
of subsidies from abroad, maintaining contact with Russian
espionage agents. These activities were too confidential even
to be mentioned in minutes.</p>

<p>Relations between the Comintern in Moscow and American
communists were almost like those between feudal lord and
serf. Moscow wanted to know everything: the background
of Party leaders, how a certain strike was getting along, the
strength of the Party in various localities. The “reps” did not
hesitate to criticize. In one Political Committee meeting a
letter from the Comintern “rep” was read. It contained the
following criticisms:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—Lack of information received relative to the Party convention;</p>

<p class="hanging">—The Party’s campaign on a certain issue, though going well,
was not strong enough. The “rep” recommended a pamphlet
be written;</p>

<p class="hanging">—Editorials in the <i>Daily Worker</i> [the Party’s newspaper] were
politically incorrect;</p>

<p class="hanging">—The Party had not taken a correct position against certain
enemies of Russia.</p>

</div>

<p>The minutes of the meeting indicate that a motion made
to accept the letter was “carried unanimously.” The Comintern’s
influence was felt in practically every communist meeting.
Every move of the American Party was watched from
Moscow. No wonder a joke making Party rounds went as
follows: Why is the Party like the Brooklyn Bridge? Because
it is suspended on cables!</p>

<p>Besides controlling its over-all policy, the Comintern used
the Communist Party in a variety of ways, especially to help
the new Soviet government in its work. In one instance the
Comintern sent over a “rep” known as Comrade Loaf. He
sent a statement, which was read at the meeting of the Political<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Committee in New York City presided over by Max
Bedacht, as Acting General Secretary, outlining his need for
assistance in collecting information on the American labor
movement for the Communist International. The Political
Committee agreed to help.</p>

<p>In another instance, Moscow referred a request for a visa
by an official of the New York <i>Jewish Daily Forward</i> to United
States comrades. Moscow in these years often used the Communist
Party in the United States as a consular clearinghouse,
seeking its advice as to whether visas should be granted or
denied. In answering this request, the already inherent anti-Semitism
of communism dictated the decision. The Soviets
were advised that the visit of the <i>Jewish Daily Forward</i> representative
would be detrimental to the Soviet Union and the
communist movement.</p>

<p>On occasions, also, the Comintern helped the Party by
arranging to receive cordially American visitors sponsored
by the Party, thereby hoping to create a favorable impression
of communism. A prominent author, for example, desired
to visit Russia for <i>The Modern Quarterly</i>. The Political
Committee instructed that a letter be written to Moscow requesting
that he be given a royal welcome. The Party wanted
him to be favorably impressed. Then, it hoped, he would
“paint a glowing picture” of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Russian control, moreover, was implemented through the
operation of another institution, the Lenin School in Moscow.
This training center was an adjunct to the Marxist-Leninist
Institute. Founded in the 1920’s, the Lenin School had for
its purpose the training of an international corps of communist
leaders. These graduates, regardless of the country
in which they operated, acted in accordance with the discipline
and policies of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union.</p>

<p>Each Communist Party was assigned a quota of students.
To be eligible, students had to have a working-class background
with experience in a trade, shop, or union. They had
to be under thirty-five years of age, either a charter member
or a member with at least five years’ experience in Party<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
work, and possess a “clean” Party record. The Comintern
studied the students’ background and approved those selected
by the Party to attend. As a general rule, students
traveled to Moscow under assumed names and with fraudulently
obtained passports.</p>

<p>The original Lenin School was located in an old Czarist
palace. Students and faculty lived under strict security
conditions. The curriculum included not only Marxist-Leninist
tactics but the theory and practice of organization, underground
and conspiratorial operations, and the tactics of revolution
and civil war. The students were taught how to erect
stout barricades, conduct guerrilla warfare, and handle firearms.
The Soviets wanted rough-and-ready revolutionists,
men who would kill, murder, blow up trains, and start revolutions.</p>

<p>Many of the top leaders in Communist Parties around the
world are graduates of the Lenin School. The National Committee
of the Communist Party in the United States today
includes such graduates of the Lenin School as Eugene Dennis,
Claude Lightfoot, Carl Winter, Simon W. Gerson, William
Weinstone, Nat Ganley, Steve Nelson, and others.
Former Lenin School graduates also include such well-known
communists as Betty Gannett, Gus Hall, Albert Lannon, Phil
Bart, Rose Wortis, Loretta Stack, Henry Winston, and numerous
others. The Lenin School became so notorious that it,
like the Comintern, was discontinued. After all, it had
turned out thousands of graduates, and the communists probably
thought it had fulfilled its usefulness.</p>

<p>The American Communist Party began to grow up. From
an infant, mostly mouth and little body, it gradually began
to take on shape and form. It was soon to increase its participation
in American life.</p>

<i>The Party Grows Up</i></h3>

</div>

<p>Prior to 1921 communists in the United States had been so
concerned with their own private squabbles and organizational
problems that they had little time for external activities.</p>

<p>After the 1921 “unification,” however, the Party, although
still weak, emerged with greater stability. It was now being
equipped with two striking arms: (1) the underground Party
apparatus and (2) the above-ground, or “false-face,” apparatus
of the Workers Party.</p>

<p>The time was ripe for communists to move in on American
life and American institutions. The first objective was organized
labor. Later the battlefront was to be extended to include
all aspects of American life up to and including activities
of the federal government in Washington.</p>

<p>Prior to 1921, by their own admission, communists had
not been particularly effective among trade unions. True,
William Z. Foster had helped found the Trade Union Educational
League in 1920, but this communist-dominated group
had made little headway. The Party at that time had lacked
the discipline and training to exploit strikes. Its aims were
usually visionary and, above all, too openly revolutionary.
During the 1919 steel strike, for example, the Communist
Party had issued this proclamation:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent allsmcap">THE WORKERS MUST CAPTURE THE POWER OF THE STATE. THEY
MUST WREST FROM THE CAPITALISTS THE MEANS THROUGH
WHICH CAPITALIST RULE IS MAINTAINED.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">The answer to the Dictatorship of the Capitalists is the
Dictatorship of the Workers.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">No wonder the Party was left in complete isolation. Such impractical
statements were but noise and scared away normal
trade-union people.</p>

<p>But the communists soon learned. Gradually they worked
their way into trade unions, and under the name of the
Workers Party propagated their program. Little by little
they became more active above ground. In 1924 the Workers
Party nominated, as candidates in the presidential elections,
William Z. Foster as President; Benjamin Gitlow, Vice-President.
In 1925, becoming still more bold, the Workers Party
changed its name to the Workers (Communist) Party. The
underground Party in the sense of being a separate organization
was discontinued, although, as in all Communist Parties,
a small underground was maintained. In 1928 communist
candidates in the presidential elections polled almost 50,000
votes Finally, in 1929, by discarding the word “Workers,”
the camouflage was dropped, and the Party became known
as the Communist Party of the United States of America.</p>

<p>During these years the communists multiplied labor troubles
and participated in a number of strikes, such as the
textile strikes in Passaic, New Jersey (1926); New Bedford,
Massachusetts (1928); and Gastonia, North Carolina (1929);
as well as the coal strike of 1922, the railroad shopmen’s
strike of 1922, and the New York furriers’ strike of 1926.
Moreover, they were becoming more active in other agitational
fields, such as economic problems, race relations, and
nationality groups. The Party, now becoming stronger, was
testing its wings in mass agitational work.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Comintern was developing the type of Party
it wanted in America. Gradually many contradictory policies
and personality conflicts were eliminated. But important differences
still existed. Many communists, for example, thought
the Party should remain underground. They opposed founding
the Workers Party. In one phase of this fight the communists
were divided into three groups, known as the Geese, the Liquidators,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
and the Conciliators. Another dispute involved the
proper method of infiltrating labor unions, with some members
being uncertain how far the Party should go to the “left” or to
the “right.” In 1923 a bitter struggle developed between factions
headed by Charles Ruthenberg and William Z. Foster.</p>

<p>In 1928 and 1929, acting under Comintern instructions, the
Communist Party conducted its first big “purges,” the mass
expulsion of large groups of members. In 1928 James P. Cannon,
an old-time communist leader, was expelled from the
Party for possessing Trotskyite tendencies, a reflection of the
Stalin-Trotsky fight in Russia. The Cannonites later formed a
new party, the Socialist Workers Party, loyal to Trotsky. In
1929 the purge was even more severe. Jay Lovestone, Executive
Secretary of the Party, and Benjamin Gitlow, a high-ranking
charter member, were expelled.</p>

<p>Stalin took a personal interest in the American situation.
Speaking in May, 1929, to the American Commission of the
Presidium of the Executive Committee of the Communist International,
he started the line that the communists were to
revive after World War II, and asserted that the United States
was heading toward a depression that would develop a revolutionary
situation.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">I think the moment is not far off when a revolutionary crisis
will develop in America.... It is essential that the American
Communist Party should be capable of meeting that historical
moment fully prepared and of assuming the leadership of the
impending class struggle in America. Every effort and every
means must be employed in preparing for that, comrades. For
that end the American Communist Party must be improved
and bolshevized. For that end we must work for the complete
liquidation of factionalism and deviations in the Party. For that
end we must work for the reestablishment of unity in the
Communist Party of America.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The Russians, by disciplinary purges, were hammering out
a Party “of a new type,” or, in the words of Stalin, bolshevizing
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>In the 1930’s, with the beginnings of the depression, the
Communist Party broadened its propaganda-agitation work.
Economic disorder was exploited. The Party organized
parades, hunger marches, petition campaigns, mass demonstrations.
It plunged with vigor into strikes such as the San Francisco
general strike of 1934 and the textile and bituminous
coal strikes of 1934-35. In November, 1935, the Congress of
Industrial Organizations (CIO) was launched, and communists
attempted to burrow themselves in its member unions.
In addition, they attempted to convert members of other labor
unions, minority groups, especially Negroes and individuals
recently arrived in the country.</p>

<p>The Party increased in numbers. By 1930, after the great
“purges,” membership stood at 7500. By 1935 it had jumped
to 30,000, and to 80,000 in 1944. The Young Communist
League, the youth organization of the Party, reached 20,000
by 1938. Communist “cells” were being formed in industrial
plants, and Party members had infiltrated governmental positions,
some even carrying out espionage. Intra-Party struggles
had ceased, with Earl Browder, a native of Kansas, being
elected in 1930 as General Secretary. He was to remain “in
power” until 1945. Step by step the Party was becoming
stabilized, developing its agitation and propaganda functions.
Disciplinary machinery maintained “unity” and “correctness of
views.” This was a period of accepting new members, broadening
struggles, and strengthening organizational structure.</p>

<p>In 1935 the Seventh World Congress of the Comintern,
meeting in Moscow, initiated the “united-front” policy, which
provided that communists should work with other groups
against fascism. Since 1933 Hitler had become the principal
target of Soviet Russia. The Bolsheviks, fearing German military
power, desperately attempted to enlist the support of the
noncommunist world against the Nazis. Russia joined the
League of Nations and became a strong supporter of the “collective
security” program aimed at holding Hitler in check.
Fascism, the communists shouted, represented a danger to
everybody, communist and noncommunist. All must work together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>The “united front” is an old Leninist tactic designed to prepare
for revolutionary situations. Internationally, the aim is to
protect the Soviet fatherland. On a local level it gives the communists
an opportunity to infiltrate, manipulate, and take over
organizations. Noncommunists are encouraged to participate in
communist campaigns with the Party, which always keeps in
mind the best way to advance its own interests. If a united-front
tactic does not promote communism, it is dropped. A new
approach is then developed.</p>

<p>The prewar period was the time of great communist fronts
in which so many innocent victims were caught. Literally
hundreds of organizations, such as the American Youth Congress,
American League Against War and Fascism (later
known as the American League for Peace and Democracy),
the American Peace Mobilization, and the National Negro
Congress sprang into existence. They were created or captured
by the communists. All were tailored, through high-sounding
names, to attract as many people as possible; the communists
had something to offer everybody. The Party during these
years moved literally thousands of Americans, causing them, in
some way or other, to support the communist cause. Their
thought-control nets were busy at work, as will be shown later.</p>

<p>In 1936 the Spanish Civil War erupted, and the communists
in the United States, amid great fanfare, sent about 3000
“volunteers,” commonly known as the Abraham Lincoln
Brigade, to aid the Spanish Loyalists. Front groups of many
types were formed to collect money, supplies, and medical
aid. Those Americans who were the leaders in the movement
to send other Americans, of whom some 50 per cent never returned,
had no interest as such in either the Franco group or
the opposing Loyalist government. They were acting, along
with international communism, to advance the Bolshevik
cause.</p>

<p>American communists used glittering promises, under-handed
tricks, and downright fraud to coax young men to go
to Spain. An enlistee might be promised a lucrative position
in Spain, cash rewards, or travel accommodations. A young
girl would entice unsuspecting men; in return for her favors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
they would promise to enlist. If necessary, fictitious passports
were obtained or enlistees were stowed away on boats. An
elaborate “convoy” system was established, individuals being
taken from the United States, usually through France, to
Spain. Any tactic was used to gain fighting manpower for the
communist cause.</p>

<p>The events of World War II were to demonstrate clearly the
loyalty of a now disciplined Communist Party to Soviet Russia.
In August, 1939, the entire world was shocked: Hitler and
Stalin had signed a “nonaggression” pact! Here was Moscow
making an agreement with that “Fascist beast,” Hitler, whom
it had denounced in bitter terms.</p>

<p>In a few days the pact’s full meaning became clear. Hitler
had made a “deal.” German forces invaded Poland. The Russians,
much more quietly, moved from the east. Poland was
partitioned and Russia annexed a large slice of Polish territory.
Hitler now turned toward the west, his “back” secure.</p>

<p>The Soviets were now in the role of “defenders of the
peace” and everyone else was an “imperialist warmonger.” If
Stalin did it, well, it was right. Hitler, the former enemy, now
became a friend and ally. The war between Germany and the
Western Allies was termed an “imperialist” war, with no support
for the Allies. There was opposition to lend-lease, the
draft and military production, support of strikes, circulation of
antiwar literature. “The Yanks Are Not Coming” was the
slogan. Russia’s war on Finland in 1939-40? That was different.
That was not imperialism, said the communists. Round-the-clock
marchers picketed the White House, urging that the
United States stay out of the European war. The pickets were
suddenly disbanded on June 21, 1941. A change in tactics
seemed imminent.</p>

<p>The next day, June 22, 1941, the Germans attacked Soviet
Russia. The European conflict now became a “patriotic war,”
a “people’s war.” The United States must lend support: war
matériel, money, and manpower. Russia was being overrun.
The revolution was in danger. A virtual nightmare gripped the
communists. Employ anything to help the land of Stalin: lend-lease,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
a second front, immediately. Strikes must be stopped.
Send relief to Russia.</p>

<p>All these moves and countermoves are not just history. They
stand as an everlasting warning of the way in which communists
in America, whatever their claims, serve only one
master: Moscow.</p>

<p>Other events in Russia had repercussions in the Communist
Party, USA, as they still do today. In 1943 Moscow dissolved
the Comintern. One purpose was to mollify Western fear and
distrust of communism. Russia, the communists claimed,
wanted to be a genuine friend. In 1944, following the new
line, the Communist Party, USA, under Browder’s leadership,
“dissolved”; actually it merely changed its name to the Communist
Political Association (CPA), a “political-educational
association.” Here again the idea was to “soften” opposition
to communism, make it sound a “little better” to Americans.
This was the period when Russia was a military ally and the
communists were trying to extract as much as they could from
this country. The best tactic, of course, was to be “friendly.”
The Communist Political Association did not have the harsh,
bugaboo connotations of the “Communist Party,” but it was
the same faithful lackey of Moscow.</p>

<p>In 1945 the war was over. Hitler was defeated. Moscow
reverted to its former hostile “line”; she denounced the Allies
and claimed full credit for destroying Hitler, and Japan too.
Communist Parties, including the one in America, were told
to be more defiant.</p>

<p>This meant another change for the communists in the United
States. In April, 1945, an article was published in a French
communist journal, <i>Cahiers du Communisme</i>, by Jacques
Duclos, then Secretary of the Communist Party of France.
Duclos condemned “Browderism,” the so-called policy of
“collaboration” with American capitalism as shown in the
CPA. This was “revisionism,” “opportunism,” and a betrayal
of Marxism-Leninism. What was needed, according to Duclos,
was a militant attack on “capitalism,” not cooperation with it.</p>

<p>The Duclos article initiated a purge in the Party, the
greatest since the days of Lovestone and Gitlow. Browder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
became the scapegoat. An emergency convention of the Communist
Political Association was hastily called and by “unanimous
vote,” except Browder’s, re-established the Communist
Party. Browder was suspended from office and later
expelled. This man from Kansas, twenty-five years a faithful
servant of the Kremlin, had served his purpose. Foster became
Chairman.</p>

<p>“Browderism” was regarded by communists as a direct outgrowth
of the Lovestone-Gitlow period. Lovestone had been
accused of espousing “American exceptionalism.” By this the
communists meant that he viewed American capitalism as
something “exceptional,” not obeying the Marxist-Leninist
laws, which teach that capitalism, because of internal contradictions,
will decay. Lovestone believed that American
capitalism was too strong to follow these Marxist rules.</p>

<p>Browder, according to his communist critics, also fell into a
similar error. He overestimated the power of American capital
and believed that, through planning, America could overcome
for some time its economic problems. This theory of “organized
capitalism,” these opponents said, was wrong. It revised
Marxist principles, weakened the communist movement, and
betrayed the “socialist future.”</p>

<p>After 1945 the Communist Party, using Browderism as a
weapon, entered into a new period of consolidation and loyalty
to Soviet Russia. The Party apparatus was tightened and
discipline strengthened. Security commissions, with almost unlimited
powers, tested the “loyalty” of members and many
were expelled. Increased restrictions on the admittance of new
members were set up. The Party press, following the Moscow
tack, inveighed against American “imperialism” and heaped
abuse on the Marshall Plan, the Greece-Turkey Aid program,
and the organization of a West European defense organization.
The old-time Stalinist, William Z. Foster, was welding the
Party into an anti-American weapon of the cold war.</p>

<p>In 1948, for the first time since the 1920’s, the Party found
itself on the defensive when the Department of Justice
initiated prosecution against its leaders. The twelve members
of the Party’s National Board were indicted under the Smith<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
Act (enacted in 1940), which prohibits any conspiracy that
advocates the overthrow of the United States government by
force and violence. Previously, in 1941, the government had
instituted prosecutions against members of the Socialist
Workers Party (Trotskyites) under this statute. Other statutes
since used by the government in the attack on the Party include
the Internal Security Act of 1950 and the Communist
Control Act of 1954.</p>

<p>In a long trial, running through most of 1949, eleven members
were convicted, the twelfth, William Z. Foster, having
been severed from the trial because of illness. In June, 1951,
the Supreme Court upheld these convictions, and the government
subsequently took prosecutive action against additional
Party leaders.</p>

<p>This government prosecution was a strong disabling blow
against the Party. Many of its top leaders were arrested and
convicted. Others lived in fear of arrest. As a result the Party
to a large extent went underground in the first large-scale
underground operation since the early 1920’s. Party offices
were closed, top Party leaders went into hiding, records were
destroyed. Courier systems were instituted and clubs broken
up into small units, if not completely disbanded. For about
four years, from mid-1951 to mid-1955, the Party in protecting
itself spent energy, time, and money that otherwise would
have gone into agitation and propaganda.</p>

<p>Again, as in previous years, events in Russia determined
communist policy in America. The death of Stalin in 1953 and
the advent of Malenkov brought the “Big Smile” policy from
the Soviet bear, which was continued by Bulganin and
Khrushchev. The Communist Party, USA, weakened and
largely immobilized in its underground haunts, welcomed
the new line. Then, in the summer of 1955, came the Geneva
Conference. The Party, sensing a new “political climate,” began
to come above ground. Quietly communist leaders reappeared
in public, many courier systems were discontinued,
and most underground hideaways abolished. By the spring of
1956 most of the Party’s underground had been curtailed and
even the communist leaders who had become fugitives from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
justice began to surrender. This experiment in underground
strategy had cost the Party severely.</p>

<p>Now, however, the Party was faced with severe problems
of internal disorganization and factionalism. Many Party members
had left the movement. Administrative affairs were in a
state of chaos. Invaluable records had been destroyed. Party
leaders, returning from underground assignments, found that
they were often ignored by the ruling hierarchy. Money was
scarce. Footholds in noncommunist organizations, such as
labor unions, had largely been lost.</p>

<p>Then came Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin and charges
of anti-Semitism in Russia. In the fall of 1956 came the bloody
Soviet intervention in Hungary. No events since the German-Russian
nonaggression pact of 1939 had so gravely shaken the
Party. Stalin, the man the comrades had revered so long, was
proved to be a murderer, thief, and liar. Communist leaders in
the United States were stunned and aghast. Immediately, different
opinions developed as to the Party’s future policy—opinions
that gave rise to severe leadership differences.</p>

<p>One group, headed by William Z. Foster, although accepting
Khrushchev’s denunciations, emphasized what “good”
Stalin had done for the communist movement. These were the
so-called Stalinists, who wanted as few changes as possible in
the Party organization. Opposing Foster was a faction headed
by John Gates, editor of the <i>Daily Worker</i>, who openly advocated
disbandment of the Party and establishment of a
political association. This action, he argued, would make the
Party more palatable to the general public in light of the
severe criticisms. In between, many middle-of-the-roaders, led
by Eugene Dennis, were not sure just what the Party should
do in this, one of its most severe crises.</p>

<p>In February, 1957, the Party assembled in its Sixteenth National
Convention, the first since 1950. The convention was
under the dictatorial control of a few Party leaders. Much deceitful
publicity was released to demonstrate that the Party
had declared its “independence” of Moscow, that a new
leadership had been installed, and that the Party was entirely
American in character. However, Foster and his associates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
so effectively manipulated the sessions that the same old
Stalinist line prevailed.</p>

<p>The Party retained its same old name, continued the
majority of its old leadership; it reaffirmed its adherence to the
basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism; it reaffirmed its acceptance
of “proletarian internationalism”; it refused to condemn or
even take a stand on the Soviet rape of Hungary; it refused to
condemn the tyranny and proven anti-Semitism of the
Soviet Union; it did not take a single affirmative step to declare
its independence of the Soviet Union; and, in fact, the
Soviet-controlled press hailed the Communist Party, USA, for
remaining loyal “to the principles of Marxism-Leninism.”</p>

<p>The Communist Party is a highly disciplined tool of the
Soviet Union in the United States. In the thirty-eight years
since it came into being, it has developed a trained and
potentially effective leadership that overnight, should the
situation become favorable, could expand into a mass organization
of great potential power. No longer does it need to send
its promising young leaders to Moscow for training, because
its own educational system is now performing that function.</p>

<p>The present menace of the Communist Party in the United
States grows in direct ratio to the rising feeling that it is a
small, dissident element and need not be feared. As we relax
our protection and ease up on security measures, we move
closer and closer to a “fool’s paradise.”</p>

<p>Through the Communist Party, the mentality of the Russian
Bolsheviks is being transmitted to America, together with the
belief that man can be completely redesigned from a child of
God into a soulless social cog. The Party member, whether he
be a farmer in Missouri, an automobile worker in Michigan,
or a lawyer in California, must be made to think, act, and be
like other Party members. Many techniques, such as discipline,
education, the Party press, recreation, literature, organizational
structure, the arts, are used to fashion the “communist
man,” the terror of the twentieth century. This is the “man”
the Kremlin hopes will place the hammer and sickle above the
White House and establish a Soviet America as part of a world
empire, with Soviet Russia as the master of all. This is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
“man” who, in a recent secret Party meeting, admonished the
comrades present that a search of history would show that
there has never been a revolution without force and violence
and when the time comes, “We will hang and shoot those
responsible for the type of government we have today.”</p>

<i>Who Are the Communists?</i></h3>

</div>

<p>The Communist Party, USA, works day and night to further
the communist plot in America. Virtually invisible to the noncommunist
eye, unhampered by time, distance, and legality,
this bolshevik transmission is in progress. The Communist
Party, USA, is bolshevizing its membership and creating communist
puppets throughout the country. The American Party,
in the Kremlin’s eyes, has for its objective the ultimate seizure
of power in America and, to accomplish this purpose, it seeks
to “educate” in the ways of communism all who will listen.</p>

<p>To appreciate the deadly seriousness of this process, the
American citizen must see how the Communist Party, USA,
by its every act, often without fanfare or newspaper headlines,
is creating a corps of dedicated Party members, supported in
many ways by United States citizens who have been infected
or misled in one way or another.</p>

<p>Millions of Americans have wondered how the communists
gain support. Frequently they seem to wield influence entirely
out of proportion to their actual numbers.</p>

<p>Party influence is exerted through the communist device of
thought control (controlling, in various degrees, the thinking
of many Americans). The communists quickly accuse anybody
who disagrees with them of being guilty of thought control;
it is a favorite communist expression. Yet this same technique,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
applied in varying degrees to different groups of our population,
is the key to communist strength in America today.</p>

<p>The Party’s objective is to drive a wedge, however slight,
into as many minds as possible. That is why, in every conceivable
way, communists try to poison our thinking about the
issues of the day: social reforms, peace, politics, veterans’,
women’s, and youth problems. The more people they can influence,
the stronger they will be.</p>

<p>Top Party officials have a definite assignment: to capture
positions of power. They are the Party’s front-line commanders.
Communism is at war with America. The United
States is a vast battlefield. A school, a labor union, a civic
group, a government official, a private citizen—all are important
in the never-ending struggle for power.</p>

<p>The whole nation, to the communists, is a gigantic checker-board.
The communist high command is constantly moving,
jumping, switching, and retreating to get communist members
in positions of influence. They are outnumbered; they know
that. That is why they must depend on skill, maneuvering, and
deception.</p>

<p>The communist official in our country realizes that his supporters
often form a motley collection, varying greatly in
loyalty: some are fanatically loyal; others are half-timers or
“single-nighters.” Many are “tremblers,” needing constant encouragement,
whereas some are just victims unwittingly
caught in the Party net.</p>

<p>But time after time the communists are able to weld these
seemingly ill-assorted supporters into a unified instrument of
power. They have succeeded in creating and dominating
different areas of thought control. Each area contains supporters
who, under Party guidance, can quickly and effectively
be mobilized. The result of this manipulation, as applied to
diverse personalities, groups, and issues, is a tribute to the
communists’ deceitful skill. By this technique, using its own
membership as a base, the Party is today influencing literally
thousands of Americans.</p>

<p>There are five principal areas, or circles, of thought control
that should be thoroughly understood. These are the keys to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
communist mobilization to achieve control of the United
States.</p>

<p class="tb">1. <i>“Open” Party members.</i> The area of highest thought control,
which is the core of communist strength, is the Party
membership. These individuals, after indoctrination, become
full-fledged revolutionaries, pledged to stick with the Party at
all times.</p>

<p>Normally they make no effort to conceal their membership.
They may be high-ranking officials, such as a state chairman, a
section organizer, a club chairman, an educational director, or
mere rank-and-file members. They are enrolled, pay dues, and
accept Party discipline.</p>

<p>The Party member must be completely obedient; that is the
hallmark of Party life. The constitution of the Communist
Party, USA, sets forth specifically this definition of a full-fledged
member:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">A Party member shall accept the Party program as determined
by the Constitution and conventions of the Party, belong to a
Party club and pay dues.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Very clearly, he is a tool of the Party.</p>

<p>Party policy is built around Party membership. The trained
member is one on whom the Party depends to commit espionage,
derail a speeding train, and organize riots. If asked,
gun in hand, to assault the Capitol of the United States, he
will be expected to obey. These members are today working to
promote a Soviet America: some in undercover assignments,
some in communist-front organizations, others as Party
officials. They are the offensive shock troops—confidently expecting
that the precise moment will arrive when conditions
will make feasible the revolutionary overthrow of our government.</p>

<p>If the Party desires to undertake a certain task, Party members,
seen or unseen, will be the leaders. Suppose that a communist
front is to be started; that is, an organization which is
to be maneuvered by the Party. A communist sympathizer may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
be named president, but a Party member will probably be
executive secretary, placed there to control policies. Or suppose
a giant rally for “peace” is to be held. The platform will
glitter with noncommunists. But a communist member on
hand will control the agenda.</p>

<p>The strength of this inner circle, the real backbone of communist
striking power, lies not in numbers but in organized
deception. Following Lenin’s teachings, the Party is a small,
compact, and highly mobile group that can strike quickly with
great fury, often achieving objectives unwarranted by its
numbers. Today’s membership is hard, well trained, and disciplined.
The weak, fainthearted, and skeptical have been
purged. Those who remain faithful to the Party are dedicated
to the communist revolution. They are willing to
sacrifice everything for it. Here is an actual case:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A Party member was given a special assignment. The first
step was to drop everything and go into hiding. That was all
he was told. He obeyed. He took another name, moved away.
Time passed. The children began to ask, “Where is Daddy?”
The mother’s answer: “He is dead. You don’t have a daddy!”</p>

</div>

<p>This is the fanaticism of the trained member.</p>

<p>To be obedient, however, is not enough. This select group
of Party members must be made superobedient, meaning subservient
beyond the hope of return. They must be constantly
whipped into a state of frenzied enthusiasm and never allowed
to relax. The moment a member “lets up” he is endangered; a
noncommunist thought might slip in. He must be made to
think exclusively in Party terms and nothing else. Some Party
members are old-timers; others are new recruits. All of them
grew up in capitalist society. Many still show the effects of
their “enemy upbringing,” especially the younger ones. That
is why they slacken once in a while. They think for themselves;
they put self before Party. These instincts must be
pounded out and communist thoughts instilled. Communists
are not born; they are made. For example:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>A Party leader in the Deep South was angry. He was talking
to a member who had “slipped” a little. This individual
was not giving his best effort to the Party, although he had
been in the Party for twelve years and had fought in Spain
with the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.</p>

<p>“Work harder for the Party,” was the leader’s theme.
“You’ve got to give more time to the Party than you’re doing
now.”</p>

<p>“And starve,” answered the other man. “I’ve got to keep my
job. I can’t make a living just doing Party work.”</p>

<p>“Let your wife work,” retorted the official. “That’ll hold you
for a while, or borrow money if need be.”</p>

<p>“But she can’t make enough. Besides, she wants to keep
house.”</p>

<p>“She’s a drawback,” flashed the leader, “a definite hindrance.
What are you going to do, stand up for the Party or
your wife?”</p>

<p>The question was direct. The individual answered, “What
do you want me to do? Divorce my wife?”</p>

<p>“If your marriage is such that you can’t work for the Party,”
came the reply, “I’d seriously consider divorce. Your wife is
selfish, simply self-centered. She wants all your time. She
doesn’t understand the movement. She’s interested in her own
happiness and security.”</p>

<p>The communist leader rammed home his point. “I’m working
all the time, so much that I can hardly sleep nights. You
can’t allow personal problems to take your mind off the Party.
You’ve got to fight that kind of pressure. Your allegiance to the
Party comes first. I never let my wife interfere. She knows
her place.”</p>

<p class="tb">2. <i>Concealed Party members.</i> Another area dominated by
communist thought control consists of the concealed communist,
the individual who, though accepting Party discipline,
does not wish his affiliation to be publicly known. These two
areas, open and concealed members, in fact, are closely related,
often interchanging and always cooperating with each
other. The concealed communist, because he is not known as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
communist, can often advance the Party’s cause among people
and in organizations where an open member would be
scorned.</p>

<p>The number of concealed communists is high. They vary in
degree of concealment. Some are concealed from the public
and are not openly identified as communists. Others are concealed
even from the membership, and a few are so deeply
hidden that only top leaders know their identity. Usually the
more prominent the individual, the more concealed he must
be.</p>

<p>Concealed communists are found in all fields. They may be
enrolled members, although secretly and usually under an
alias or assumed name; or their names may never appear on
official rolls. It does not matter. They are viewed by Party
leaders as members. They are equally as dangerous as the open
member, if not more so. They are difficult to identify and,
being concealed, can operate freely in noncommunist groups.</p>

<p>A physician, a lawyer, an educator, a personnel manager in
a business firm, a television script writer—each may be a concealed
communist of great value to the Party. Suppose that a
Party member is in hiding. He becomes ill. The doctor, a concealed
communist, is called. He can be trusted. Or a study
group is formed on a campus. The professor “guides” the discussion
and subtly engenders communist doctrine. A personnel
manager hires communist sympathizers, working them into
key positions. Party influence increases, almost without anybody’s
knowing it. Here is an example of how the system
works:</p>

<p>Two men huddle in conversation. One is a top Party
official; the other, a high-ranking labor union leader who is a
concealed communist, although his union has since ousted him
from his post.</p>

<p>The national convention of the union is about to open in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Party official is issuing instructions.
Support this, support that. He talks in great detail,
laying down the over-all Party policy. Then he becomes more
specific, even going so far as to dictate the wording of resolutions,
suggesting the order of convention business, and advising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
how certain personalities should be handled. Nothing
is to be left to chance.</p>

<p>The union, leader listens. He can go on the convention floor,
since nobody knows that he is under Party discipline, and
carry out the communist program. This concealed communist
is essential to the Party’s thought-control technique. There are
thousands like him always seeking to penetrate the healthy
body of American life and to corrupt it.</p>

<p>In another case, a top communist leader, long before he fled
into the communist underground, was confronted with the
problem of being identified, for he was well known and his
picture had been widely publicized in the press. He could dye
his hair, shave off his mustache, and lose weight, but he still
could be readily identified by a mole on the right side of his
jaw. He went to a physician in a Midwest city, a reported
communist, who operated on the Party leader to remove the
mole from his face.</p>

<p>Another concealed member of the Party was the editor-in-chief
of a conservative book-publishing house. This editor,
having an excellent educational background, was highly regarded
by his company. On one occasion, after this publishing
house had been criticized by a newspaper columnist for publishing
procommunist books, the president discussed the
problem at a meeting of the board of directors. He reported
that he had asked the editor if, in fact, he was a member of
the Communist Party. The editor entered an emphatic denial.
The president then advised the board that since the editor
was a gentleman, the allegations that he was a communist
were false.</p>

<p>The president of the publishing house simply did not know
the facts. The editor’s usual procedure was to have the manuscript
of a communist author submitted directly to him on a
personal basis. He would review it, be sure it was in publishable
form, then have the author submit it to the publishing
house through routine channels. Receiving the manuscript
later through the company, he would recommend its publication.
Through this technique, the editor was eminently successful
in circulating communist literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>When noncommunist authors complained and several terminated
their relations with the publisher, the editor was later
quietly eased out of his job.</p>

<p>There are occasions when a member of the Party will drop
his open Party activities, move to another section of the country,
and become a secret, concealed member. Such was the
case of a talented young man who became active in the Communist
Party in New York City before World War II when he
was employed by a motion-picture company. After work he
functioned as a Communist Party organizer, later as a membership
director of a Party club, and, for a while, worked on
the paid staff of the American Labor Party. In the meantime
he obtained a job in television and in 1953 became program
director of a television station in a large Southern city.</p>

<p>Soon after his arrival in the Southern city, the TV program
director started to meet secretly with the Party’s “white-collar”
professional group. Word came through that he should sever
even these connections, according to a Party functionary, who
said, “We want them [him and his wife] to be secure for the
Party.” He was too valuable a member to be compromised.
The Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, however, uncovered
the white-collar professional cell, and when the TV
director declined to answer Committee questions, he was
promptly fired by his employer.</p>

<p class="tb">3. <i>Fellow travelers.</i> The third area in which communist
thought control works is that of the fellow traveler and sympathizer.
These two terms are distinct but related. The fellow
traveler, while not a member, actively supports (travels with)
the Party’s program for a period of time. The sympathizer is
more passive, sympathizing with the Party or individual members
on specific issues, and may or may not give active aid.
These individuals are not Party members, but, in some degree,
have come under Party control.</p>

<p>This control is sufficient to make them work willingly for
the Party. Many consistently follow the Party line, even maintaining
personal contacts with Communist Party officials.
Others, the so-called “intellectuals,” may never have attended<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
a communist meeting and may know nothing about Party
organization. Yet, because of the spell of communist thought
control, they knowingly do the Party’s work. Perhaps they
have been influenced by Marxist writings or the professed
aims of the Party on certain issues. In any case, deluded by
communist propaganda, they desire to render active assistance.</p>

<p>Fellow travelers and sympathizers, unlike open or concealed
communists, cannot be disciplined. A Party leader may request
a favor. If the fellow traveler or sympathizer agrees, fine; if he
doesn’t, the Party cannot do much except hope to exert more
influence next time.</p>

<p>Moreover, these people are often undependable, donating
money, for example, to one Party function but not another.
Sometimes they may be “hot,” doing just about anything
asked. Then suddenly they grow “cold,” lose interest, and
become inactive.</p>

<p>The value of fellow travelers and sympathizers lies in their
alleged noncommunist affiliation. That is why, in most instances,
communist leaders do not attempt to recruit them into
the Party. They are more valuable outside: as financial contributors,
vocal mouthpieces, or contacts between Party
officials and noncommunists. They constitute, in fact, fronts
for, and defenders of, the Communist Party.</p>

<p>The role these individuals can play for the communists is
clearly illustrated in front organizations, where they serve as
sponsors or officials. Behind the scenes is a communist manipulator.
Consider, for example, one such organization. In
October, 1951, the <i>Daily Worker</i> announced the formation of
the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee with one hundred
fifty founders (from thirty-nine states), including fifty who
were educators, clergymen, and professionals.</p>

<p>One of the Committee’s first official moves was to petition
the New York State Commissioner of Education to “forbid the
New York City Board of Education from enforcing its newly-enacted
ban on suspected communist teachers....” Gradually,
as the old Civil Rights Congress, a well-known front, became
discredited, the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee took
over its work. In 1956 the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
after identifying the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee,
stated, “When the Communist Party itself is under fire
these fronts offer a bulwark of protection.”</p>

<p>The names of the group’s one hundred fifty founders have
been exploited by the Party to fight its battles.</p>

<p>To make a known Party member president of a front would
immediately label it as “communist.” But if a sympathizer can
be installed, especially a man of prominence, such as an educator,
minister, or scientist, the group can operate as an “independent”
organization. This trick has worked time after time
and is still working today. By allowing themselves to be used
as tools, fellow travelers and sympathizers have immeasurably
advanced the communist cause.</p>

<p>In Chapter 17 we shall discuss communist fronts in greater
detail.</p>

<p>Of particular interest to the communists is the influence of
fellow travelers and sympathizers in the “thought-molding”
field: teachers, script writers, newspapermen, news analysts.
If these individuals can be subjected to the slightest bit of
communist thought control, the Party will have won a major
victory.</p>

<p>One individual in New York City, for example, once occupied
an important role as a news commentator and author. His
views were consistently procommunist. He represented himself
as an authority on international affairs. He claimed to have
talked personally to many of the world’s leaders. Just as the
communists would want, everywhere he went he built himself
up as an individual who could give the American people
guidance in their thinking.</p>

<p>This sympathizer was simply irreplaceable in the communist
scheme. No open communist could discuss current events before
lecture audiences, behind the microphone, or through the
written word with his degree of “objectivity” and “independence.”
He was able to fool many noncommunists and
exert considerable influence. His lecture tours were often arranged
by communist-front groups. A concealed communist
contributed money to his expenses. Wherever this “world
observer” went, he preached communist-line and pro-Soviet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
propaganda. When his influence began to slip, he then
changed his ways and sought his livelihood elsewhere.</p>

<p>Men and women of this caliber can do much to bring others
into the communist thought-control net. No wonder the Party
works to support them.</p>

<p class="tb">4. <i>Opportunists.</i> Another group that falls, on occasion,
under communist thought control consists of opportunists, individuals
who, if they can benefit personally, will knowingly
support the Party in return for support or favors from it. Opportunists
are cynical and self-seeking, not caring that by
cooperating with the communists, even though temporarily,
they are injuring the nation.</p>

<p>In a large Midwestern city a noncommunist labor leader had
aspirations to become president of a union council. A group of
communists, opposed to the then president, decided that this
labor leader could be controlled. They drafted him as a candidate
and, of course, on the election slate placed also some
Party members. The labor leader won the election, and so did
the communists, because they gained a man over whom they
had a hold and whom they could therefore expect to use.</p>

<p>The opportunist was then pushed into various front organizations:
he was put on the board of a communist-sponsored
school; designated as a delegate to a convention of a front
group; enlisted to join a campaign to oppose the “anticommunist
clause” in a state-wide labor convention. He was besieged
constantly to “do this” and “help us.” His value to the
Party was shown, for example, when, even though he refused
on a certain occasion to cooperate with a Party front, his position
was defended by the Party. The opportunist, in the
Party’s eyes, was more important to it as a labor leader than
as a supporter of the front.</p>

<p>For some time the deal paid off. The opportunist received
the prestige and the communists had a champion. Then things
began to change. The opportunist had his own ideas and
ceased to follow the Party lead. Relations became strained.
When the communists wanted the city-wide council to endorse
a well-known comrade as a candidate for the board of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
education, they brought up the motion at a meeting when the
opportunist was absent. The communist candidate was endorsed.
That was too much for the opportunist, who promptly
issued a public statement denying that he was backing the
communist candidate. A special meeting of the council was
called to reconsider its action.</p>

<p>The communists now moved into high gear. Word went out
that the opportunist would have to be “put in his place” for
publicly denouncing the communist candidate. At a special
meeting the opportunist took the floor and successfully led the
fight to reverse the council’s endorsement of a communist. The
communists were bitter in their condemnation of their onetime
protégé; he was a “traitor” and a “hypocrite.” Deciding
he had had enough, the opportunist resigned the presidency.</p>

<p>In such a case who is the ultimate winner? The communists,
for they have advanced their program. When he, the opportunist,
faltered, he was dropped.</p>

<p>Communists watch eagerly for such opportunists; they are
usually easy to influence and exploit. The self-seeker, fighting
to win an election or wanting to earn some easy money, may
listen to communist double talk and cooperate. Not that the
Party is under any illusions; the opportunist is not going to be
converted. He will denounce communist support just as quickly
as he accepted it. Relations are strictly “dog eat dog,” each
trying to exploit the other. But the opportunist can be used.</p>

<p class="tb">5. <i>Dupes.</i> The final area is that of the dupe, or innocent
victim, the individual who unknowingly is under communist
thought control and does the work of the Party. A tragedy of
the past generation in the United States is that so many persons,
including high-ranking statesmen, public officials, educators,
ministers of the gospel, professional men, have been
duped into helping communism. Communist leaders have proclaimed
that communism must be partly built with noncommunist
hands, and this, to a large extent, is true.</p>

<p>Communist propaganda is tailored to attract noncommunists.
Communism offers a bogus “spiritual appeal,” a
“Kingdom of God on earth.” Its tactics and strategy are covered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
with attractive, appealing words, such as “freedom,”
“justice,” and “equality.” The communists claim they are
working for a “better world,” that they have the answer to
discrimination, exploitation, and economic want. To fight for
communism, they say, is to become part of the most sacred
crusade in the history of man.</p>

<p>Many well-meaning citizens, attracted by these words and
not seeing behind the communist intentions, have been swept
into the communist thought-control net. Most are sincerely
interested in improving society, and there are many ways in
which our society can and should be improved. They are willing
to devote their time, talents, and energies to a “sacred
cause.” That is how communist thought control works. If it
can influence you on any matter, regardless of how minor,
making you think favorably toward communism, it has gained.
It has something to sell everyone.</p>

<p>“Fool the noncommunists!” That is the slogan. And, better
still, make noncommunists fool each other! Encourage the support
of as many dupes as possible. These individuals see only
the exterior, or false face, of communism. They are never
shown the inside, the real communism, the terror, injustice,
and slavery. Time after time, in almost unbelievable fashion,
victims, somehow or other under communist thought control,
do communism’s work: signing communist election petitions,
contributing time or money to communist fronts, issuing statements
in support of communist-sponsored campaigns.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a member of the National Committee
of the Communist Party, USA, quite recently was a
candidate for the New York City Council under the emblem
of the People’s Rights Party. Communists canvassed to obtain
at least 3000 signatures on petitions required by law to place
her name on the ballot. They went over the goal with the help
of noncommunists. In the November 5, 1957, election, however,
Flynn received fewer than 1000 votes.</p>

<p>The People’s Rights Party is a sham political party created
to give the Communist Party the legal right to run communist
candidates. In 1946, 1952, 1954, and again in 1957 communist
candidates have run for municipal, state, or national<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
office in New York City under the banner of the People’s
Rights Party. Each time signatures had to be obtained to
secure the right of the PRP to place its candidates on the
ballot.</p>

<p>Another instance of Party manipulation to gain the support
of noncommunists was the campaign in the summer of 1957 to
solicit signatures for petitions opposing the further testing of
nuclear weapons by the United States government. Most of
these signatures, of course, were those of noncommunists. On
this issue the Party was slavishly following the line of international
communism. Communist strategy is to provide the
leadership, encouraging noncommunists to do the work.</p>

<p>Not that these individuals are communists. The great majority
of them are loyal, but deceived, citizens. Sending five
dollars to a front organization with a patriotic-sounding name;
signing a communist-inspired petition urging “world disarmament”
(isn’t that a worthy cause?); attending a giant Party-manipulated
rally in support of the “Bill of Rights”: the noncommunist
does not realize these campaigns are being operated
out of downtown communist headquarters. He is fooled
because he believes in the aims they profess and does not
recognize the hidden motive.</p>

<p>But, from the communist point of view, a dollar is a dollar.
A victim makes a contribution. His money is just as good as
money from an open member. A noncommunist allows his
name to be used on a letterhead. Suppose he was fooled? The
name is still there. Thus the communists assemble support
from all quarters, whether given intentionally or not, and
apply it toward their objectives.</p>

<p>Party officials, like fishermen, are constantly watching their
“nets” to see what the fishing will bring. Each day, unfortunately,
communist thought-control nets, sweeping through
American life, catch new supporters, maybe two or three new
members, several sympathizers, an opportunist, many victims.
A “big-name” sympathizer is worth a great deal and so is another
fellow traveler. Each can be put to work. The strength of
the Communist Party depends, at any given time, on the number
of fish in the net.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>How can we, as Americans, protect ourselves from becoming
“innocent victims” of the communists?</p>

<p>First, we should not fall for “fronts.” In Chapter 17 you will
find a detailed description of how communist fronts operate,
together with a twelve-point list of ways to spot them so that
we will not be fooled into giving them our support. (The
Attorney General of the United States has issued a list of subversive
organizations, and the House Committee on Un-American
Activities has also issued a <i>Guide to Subversive
Organizations and Publications</i>.)</p>

<p>Second, we should know the answers to the <i>Five False
Claims of Communism</i>. In the next chapter we shall learn what
those claims are and how United States communists use them
to disarm and confuse loyal Americans. We should learn to
spot those claims, and know the answers.</p>

<p>Finally, we should not permit the use of our names unless
we know the true identity of the soliciting group. We should
use our right of petition to further the American way of life,
and not allow the communists to steal it from us.</p>

<div class="chapter box2b">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_7">7.<br>
<i>What Do U.S. Communists Claim?</i></h3>

</div>

<p>I have said that one of the chief strengths of the Communist
Party has been its ability to appeal, by trickery, to many
Americans who are sincere, idealistic, and well-meaning.</p>

<p>A first step in arming ourselves against communism is to
know how those appeals are made and how to see through
them. So now let us consider five of the most deceptive claims
made by the Communist Party, USA, in its effort to lure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
“innocent victims.” Let’s see what communists pretend to be
and what they really are:</p>

<p class="tb">1. <i>Communists are not liberals.</i> The concept that communism
is a new world of liberalism is false, a trap used to
catch noncommunists. The word “liberal” has a fine, upright
meaning and is symbolic of a great historic tradition. That is
why the communists appropriate the term for their own use.</p>

<p>Communism is the very opposite of liberalism. Liberalism
means increased rights for the citizen; a curb on the powers of
the central government; freedom of speech, religion, and the
press. Communism means fewer and fewer rights for the private
citizen, curtailment of freedom of speech and press and
worship of God. The state becomes all-powerful, the absolute
reverse of American tradition.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, communists do not like liberalism; that
is, the genuine liberalism of Western civilization. They denounce
liberals (“liberal blockheads” Lenin called them) and
attempt by every means to destroy them. The communists
realize that true liberalism is a bitter enemy, a fighter for the
things that communism opposes.</p>

<p>A derisive poem entitled “March of the Liberals” published
in the July 16, 1935, issue of <i>New Masses</i> (a now-defunct
communist publication) makes clear this communist attitude,
depicting liberals as weak, vacillating, and incapable of any
affirmative action:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">a conclusion is something</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">we never can find....</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">... One step forward</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">and two steps back:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">that’s the method</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of our attack.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“You see here,” <i>New Masses</i> comments, “the rhyme and
reason of why a liberal looks so poisonous to a sincere and
active radical....” The “antidote” for such liberalism?
“Weekly doses” of Marxism-Leninism, or, in the words of the
editors, “If you know one of these ‘open-minded’ marchers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
you can save him! Give him a copy of <span class="allsmcap">NEW MASSES</span> quick....”</p>

<p>The liberals do not want revolution but genuine social reforms.
That is why the communists detest them. But if they
can be exploited, so much the better. Like everybody else,
they are fuel for the communist engine of revolution.</p>

<p class="tb">2. <i>Communists are not progressives.</i> “We of the Communist
Party are fully and completely in the camp of progress....”
A prime tenet of communist propaganda is that communism
is the latest word in social progress. All other forms of
government, especially our constitutional government, according
to the communists are outmoded, old-fashioned, and
antique. Communism is the wave of the future, they like to
say, bringing all the good things that man has been dreaming
about for years. Religion, the “opium” of the people, must be
destroyed, God cast out, and the “oppressors” liquidated. The
road ahead is clear. Join the Communist Party and see
“progress.” Those who do not join are “reactionaries,”
“fascists,” and “warmongers.”</p>

<p>Everybody likes progress. If you are a farmer, you want to
grow better corn and more of it. If you have a lawn, you want
to weed out the dandelions and have better grass. If you are
a manufacturer, you want to develop a better product. This is
a natural human trait. The communists, identifying themselves
with this idea, have convinced many people that they are the
“progressives” of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>The exact opposite is true. Communists are barbarians in
modern dress, using both club and blood purge.</p>

<p>Shortly before 1700 Peter the Great came to the throne in
Russia. He was ruthless and dictatorial. He was interested in
making the Russian state strong. The church, the nobles, the
peasants, everybody must be subjected. The most minute details
came under his supervision. The army was reorganized,
a new civil service put into operation. He even ordered men
to shave their beards and women to dress in modern clothing.
The law was what he said it was.</p>

<p>Communists have inherited this tradition. With modern,
efficient tools, such as the secret police, the army, and control<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
of communications, they have increased the tyranny of the
state. The individual under communism is a mere number with
two shoulders to carry a bale of hay or a couple of feed sacks,
two hands to pull a wagon or drive a tractor. This is not
progress but a turning backward, throwing away the fruits of
history, religion, and free government.</p>

<p class="tb">3. <i>Communists are not social reformers</i>, people working for
the betterment of living conditions. “The Communist Party ...
champions the ... interests of the workers, farmers, the Negro
people and all others who labor by hand and brain....” This
theme, here quoted from the 1957 Party Constitution, is exploited
time after time, to attract noncommunist support.</p>

<p>Some years ago a very distinguished person, after reading a
summary of the program of a communist-front organization,
commented that if communists worked for desirable objectives,
that was praiseworthy. However, in this individual’s
opinion, such action could hardly represent much of a gain
for communism, except perhaps to make it more like democracy.</p>

<p>This is a complete misunderstanding of communism and is
just what the Party desires. The communists detest democratic
reforms. These changes, they know, will make free government
stronger, hence less likely to be overthrown by revolution.
Their espousal of reforms (higher wages, better working
conditions, elimination of racial discrimination) is strictly a
revolutionary tactic. That communism, by such mass agitation,
might gradually change to democracy is a false and dangerous
illusion. Communism’s goal is world revolution. Any device
that will advance its cause is urgently pursued.</p>

<p>Lenin himself is frank:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The strictest loyalty to the ideas of Communism must be combined
with the ability to make all the necessary practical compromises,
to “tack,” to make agreements, zigzags, retreats and
so on....</p>

</div>

<p class="tb">4. <i>The Communists do not believe in democracy.</i> Communist
leaders of all ranks, from N. S. Khrushchev to William Z.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Foster, from Lenin to the communist agitator on the corner of
12th and Market Streets, have proclaimed that communism
is the most highly developed form of democracy. Lenin stated
that the Soviet Union was “a million times more democratic”
than the most advanced capitalist democracies of the West.
William Z. Foster in an official statement commented, “The
Communist Party is a democratic movement,” adding:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">And in the Soviet Union ... there exists a higher type of
democracy than in any other country in the world.</p>

</div>

<p>Mention must be made, to understand this double talk, of
a communist deceptive device called <i>Aesopian language</i>.</p>

<p>Nearly everyone is familiar with the fables of Aesop, such
as “The Fox and the Crow” and “The Lion and the Mouse.”
Often the point of the story is not directly stated but must be
inferred by the reader. This is a “roundabout” presentation.</p>

<p>Lenin and his associates before 1917, when living in exile,
made frequent use of “Aesopianism.” Much of their propaganda
was written in a “roundabout” and elusive style to pass
severe Czarist censorship. They desired revolution but could
not say so. They had to resort to hints, theoretical discussions,
even substituting words, which, though fooling the censor,
were understood by the “initiated,” that is, individuals trained
in Party terminology.</p>

<p>The official <i>History of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union (Bolsheviks)</i>, telling how Bolshevik agitation in Saint
Petersburg in 1912-14 was led by <i>Pravda</i>, the communist
newspaper, explained that the periodical could not openly call
for revolutionary action. That would have brought government
suppression. Rather, “hints,” understood by the communists,
were used:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">When, for example, <i>Pravda</i> wrote of the “full and uncurtailed
demands of the Year Five,” the workers understood that this
meant the revolutionary slogans of the Bolsheviks, namely, the
overthrow of tsardom....</p>

</div>

<p>In 1914 labor troubles sprang up in the capital of Russia. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
communists wanted mass meetings and demonstrations. <i>Pravda</i>
couldn’t publicly sound the call, so it resorted to Aesopian
language.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">But [the communist <i>History</i> reads] the call was understood by
class-conscious workers when they read an article by Lenin
bearing the modest title “Forms of the Working-Class Movement”
and stating that at the given moment strikes should
yield place to a higher form of the working-class movement—which
meant a call to organize meetings and demonstrations.</p>

</div>

<p>Lenin himself told how he was compelled to write:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">with an eye to the tsarist censorship. Hence, I was not only
forced to confine myself strictly to an exclusively theoretical,
mainly economic analysis of facts, but to formulate the few
necessary observations on politics with extreme caution, by
hints, in that Aesopian language—in that cursed Aesopian
language—to which tsarism compelled all revolutionaries to
have recourse, whenever they took up their pens to write a
“legal” work.</p>

</div>

<p>In one propaganda tract Lenin, writing about world problems,
mentioned “Japan.” However, as he later explained, that
was merely a trick to pass the censor. “The careful reader,”
Lenin said, “will easily substitute Russia for Japan....”</p>

<p>So it is with the word “democracy.” Communists still use
Aesopian language; they say one thing and mean another. In
this manner they fool noncommunists, encouraging them to
believe that communism stands for something desirable. The
trained communist knows otherwise: it is mere double talk
with a completely different meaning.</p>

<p>The word “democracy” is one of the communists’ favorite
Aesopian terms. They say they favor democracy, that communism
will bring the fullest democracy in the history of mankind.
But, to the communists, democracy does not mean free
speech, free elections, or the right of minorities to exist.
Democracy means the domination of the communist state, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
complete supremacy of the Party. The greater the communist
control, the more “democracy.” “Full democracy,” to the communist,
will come only when all noncommunist opposition is
liquidated.</p>

<p>Such expressions as “democracy,” “equality,” “freedom,”
and “justice” are merely the Party’s Aesopian devices to impress
noncommunists. Communists are masters at getting other
people to do their work. They clothe themselves with everything
good, noble, and inspiring to exploit these ideals to their
own advantage.</p>

<p class="tb">5. <i>Communists are not American.</i> The Communist Party,
USA, endeavors, in every possible way, to convince this country
that it is American. “The Communist Party is American,”
one of its top leaders recently proclaimed. “... We take
second place to nobody in our devotion to the United States
and its people.”</p>

<p>This is a typical Aesopian trick. Communism stands for
everything America abhors: slave camps, rigged elections,
purges, dictatorship. As we saw in Part II, the communist
movement was born abroad, was imported into the United
States, and grew up under the personal direction of Russian
leaders in Moscow. How can communism be American when
it employs every form of treason and trickery to bring about
ultimate domination of the United States by a foreign power?</p>

<p>The American people, fortunately, are now more than ever
aware of the danger of communism. The hostile attitude of
Soviet Russia in international affairs, the Canadian spy revelations,
Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin, Soviet intervention
in Hungary, the aggression in Korea—all these events, and
many more, have taught Americans that the communist is not
an angel of mercy, ministering to the weak, oppressed, and
wounded, but a menacing demon spattered with blood and
wielding a hammer and sickle of iron.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, great damage has been done, and is still being
done, in miscalculating and failing to understand the true
nature of communism. In the 1930’s, and especially during<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
World War II when Russia was a military ally, this foreign
ideology gained tremendous strength.</p>

<p>The Party in 1944 claimed a membership of 80,000. Communist
fronts welcomed overflow crowds; distinguished citizens
flocked to do their work. A great backlog of influence was
built up upon which the Party is still drawing. Thought-control
nets touched, in one way or another, literally thousands
of sympathizers and victims. Many individuals, people who
should have known better, went completely overboard, hailing
communism as “Twentieth-century Americanism,” a term
widely publicized by the communists themselves.</p>

<p>Henry A. Wallace, in a frank and forthright article entitled
“Where I Was Wrong,” published in <i>This Week</i> magazine on
September 7, 1952, graphically pictured the communist power
of deception, how he incorrectly interpreted communism and
its counterpart, Russian imperialism.</p>

<p>While Vice-President of the United States, and even later,
Wallace thought Russia “wanted and needed peace.” He
visited the Soviet Union in 1944 and was favorably impressed.
But, as the article relates, he did not realize during his tour
the feverish efforts being made by the Soviets to hoodwink
him. For example, he visited Magadan, a city in Siberia, which
was one of the Soviets’ most notorious slave labor camps.
“Nothing I saw at Magadan or anywhere else in Soviet Asia
suggested slave labor.” Later he learned of the Soviet actions</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... to pull the wool over our eyes and make Magadan into a
Potemkin village [an ideal show city especially built for visitors]
for my inspection. Watch towers were torn down.
Prisoners were herded away out of sight. On this basis, what
we saw produced a false impression.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Mr. Wallace then added these important words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... what I did not see was the Soviet determination to enslave
the common man morally, mentally and physically for its own
imperial purposes.</p>

</div>

<p>The communists claim to be many things they are not. All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
over the world and in every field of human life they have
erected false fronts, Potemkin villages, to fool and enslave
mankind.</p>

<i>Why Do People Become Communists?</i></h3>

</div>

<p>In the last chapter the Five False Claims of Communism
showed how, in truth, communists stand for everything that
is abhorred by normal Americans.</p>

<p>Why, then, do Americans turn communist?</p>

<p>The answer involves many details and is not simple. Most
communists are ordinary-looking people, like your seatmate
on the bus or a clerk in one of your neighborhood stores.</p>

<p>Most communists in the United States are now native-born.
Others are naturalized citizens; a few are aliens. Some have
never gone to school and have difficulty reading and writing.
Many are well educated and have college and university
degrees. Often they possess special talents in one field or another.</p>

<p>A member may earn his living in practically any occupation
or profession. Not long ago a large Communist Party section
listed members in these categories, tabulated as “professional
and white collar”: artists, actors, doctors, dentists, educators,
engineers, draftsmen, lawyers, musicians, nurses, newspaper
writers, office workers, salesmen, social-service workers, pharmacists,
clergymen. Or a member may be a butcher, carpenter,
mechanic, truck driver, plumber, or laborer.</p>

<p>Members are recruited from all nationalities, races, and
areas of the country. They may live in expensive mansions or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
tumble-down homes. They are of all ages. Never can a communist
be identified simply by his physical appearance, occupation,
or clothes.</p>

<p>Why, you may ask, do these individuals join? And why,
especially in this country, which, under democracy, has such
a long and heartening record of expanding privilege and
opportunity for so many?</p>

<p>Perhaps we can better understand why members join if we
look at an actual case, which we can call the Case of Lost
Faith.</p>

<p>Jack was born in a Midwestern city. He was tall, brown-haired,
and possessed a pleasant disposition. He liked school
and endeavored to please his teachers. He was intensely
curious concerning the world about him, especially the physical
sciences.</p>

<p>Then something started to happen to him, slowly but surely.
His faith in God and religion seemed to be fading. As he later
told FBI agents, he felt this loss already in high school. By the
time of his graduation his faith in religion, which as a small
child had been most sincere and tenacious, had completely
disappeared. There was now inside him a spiritual vacuum.</p>

<p>Upon entering college Jack found himself with an exceedingly
curious mind but one uncontrolled by any spiritual faith.
In a class on government he made the acquaintance of the
<i>Communist Manifesto</i>. Later he read sections of Engels’ <i>Anti-Dühring</i>,
which, among other things, discusses Marxist theory
in relation to science. He was impressed. Here were some ideas
that seemed to offer something positive and new.</p>

<p>Then one day, almost by chance, he came upon a leaflet
distributed on the campus by a communist club. Jack became
interested and made contact with the Party. Here, for the first
time, he seemed to find an “answer” to the problems that had
plagued him. Here, in the Party’s claim to be working for a
better world, Jack believed he had found a new “faith,” which
would give meaning and validity to his life. Though later he
was to realize his tragic error, Jack joined the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>In many instances we know, joining the Communist Party<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
comes from a loss of faith, so to speak, in our Judaic-Christian
heritage and earnest, though perverted, seeking for a new
faith. The individual is trying to find solutions to problems,
real or fancied, that disturb his life. Many reasons cause individuals
to join the Party, but undoubtedly most important is
the Party’s appeal to idealistic motivations, to a “bright new
world” where justice, peace, and freedom will replace strife,
injustice, and inhumanity. “I believed that in the Communist
Party was the beginning of a true brotherhood of man, working
with devotion for socialism, peace and democracy,” wrote
Howard Fast, one of the Party’s best-known writers, later to
become bitterly disillusioned. “... I believed, as did millions
of men of good will, that the only truth about the Soviet Union
was the picture presented by friends of the Soviet Union.”</p>

<p>Communism with its deceitful double talk exploits these
basic human yearnings for better social conditions, racial
equality, justice, and peace, and places them in the service of
tyranny. In this way, strange as it may sound, communists are
able to entice free men to fight for slavery in the name of freedom.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this idealistic motivation has given thousands
of members, from brilliant scientists like Klaus Fuchs to
ordinary laboring men, undaunted zeal and enthusiasm. Members
driven on by this idealism have been willing to sacrifice
their homes, families, and lives for the cause. They have become
inflamed with a passionate, though twisted, courage.
This is the motivation of the New York functionary who
thought that five or six hours of sleep a night were sufficient
for any member and regarded any request for time off as
traitorous. “You can get your recreation after the revolution,”
she once snapped at an associate.</p>

<p>The Communist Party, in a very true sense, becomes as in
the case of Jack a new but bigoted faith.</p>

<p>The FBI has interviewed many hundreds of Party members.
A few case histories will illustrate why many joined. By
understanding these influences we can do much to defeat the
Party’s present recruitment drive.</p>

<p>Let’s take the case of Eric. He is typical of the many who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
joined the Party during the economic depression. He remembered
his youth as days of “deprivation.” He worked at odd
jobs, such as helping the milkman and caring for chickens.
But everywhere he went he met bitter frustrations. He became
more and more dissatisfied with existing economic conditions.</p>

<p>Then one day at a secondhand bookstore he came upon
some documents that alleged very unsatisfactory conditions
in American economic life. Eric bought and read these documents.
“The effect upon me was profound; I don’t believe
that anything I have ever read has had the same impact upon
me since.” In his own words, he felt a “terrific compulsion ...
to do something to help better the conditions brought out in
the report.” He was swept up by a desire to wipe out
prejudice, to “help bring the underdog of our civilization up
to a place of dignity.”</p>

<p>Eric had never talked to a Party member. He had no personal
knowledge of communism. Yet somewhere he had
formed a false impression of the Communist Party, based on
communist propaganda. “I knew that it ... somehow had come
to believe that it considered all men equal, that it was fighting
for the underdog, that it had no prejudices against color of
skin or religion.”</p>

<p>Motivated by these errors, Eric on his own initiative went to
a corner drugstore, looked up the Party’s address in the telephone
directory, and called headquarters. He told how Party
officials seemed “surprised” when he stated his desire to join.</p>

<p>With determination in his heart, Eric went to Party headquarters,
climbed the brownstone steps to the front door, and
rang the bell. A young lady answered. He asked if this was
Party headquarters. She said no but pointed to a basement
entrance. There, in the presence of an eighteen-year-old girl
and a dark-haired, stooped man, Eric signed an application
card for Party membership. His tragic decision had been
made with gusto and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Karl as a young man, like Eric, was deeply affected by the
depression. He told how he had seen people eating out of
garbage cans. He felt that something had to be done to remedy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
conditions. Moreover, in his opinion, the incumbent government
was not adequate to cope with the problems.</p>

<p>Soon he began to read communist literature and in 1934
joined the Young Communist League. But this was to be only
the beginning.</p>

<p>In 1936 came the Spanish Civil War. Karl, because of communist
agitation, became deeply interested. He detested Hitler
and fascism. Mussolini and his Black Shirts were even more
detestable. The more he thought about international developments,
the more he had the urge to take a personal hand in the
situation. His hatred of fascism was intensified when some of
his relatives had to flee from Europe because of Mussolini’s
persecution.</p>

<p>Full of youthful vigor, Karl went to Spain as a volunteer in
the Abraham Lincoln Brigade. Here on the front lines he was
wounded and to this day bears the effects of the injury. This
impetuous decision, taken against the advice of his family,
represented a contribution of the Communist Party of the
United States to international communism. Karl’s idealistic
fervor against fascism and injustice was translated into shot
and powder for the furtherance of communist aims.</p>

<p>Many thousands of Americans joined the communist movement
during these early days of the fight against fascism. The
hardships of depression days contributed to the deceptive appeals
of communism. These men and women, seeking solutions,
thought incorrectly that the panacea lay in communism.
They labored under the illusion that the Party and Soviet
Russia represented a better democracy. As one disillusioned
member was later to complain, “At this time the Communist
apologists stressed idealistic goals, and bragged of a growing
democracy in Russia.”</p>

<p>Many individuals have joined the Party in the vain hope of
improving social conditions, gaining better housing, or achieving
better relations between the races.</p>

<p>Ralph was typical of many. He was a Negro, proud of his
race and eager to help better its status in America. While in
school he prepared a thesis on this subject. Wanting to secure
various opinions, he asked several friends to read his manuscript.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
One of these, a fellow student, remarked after reading
the paper that Ralph’s approach had been very naïve and that
further study should be undertaken. Thereupon he furnished
Ralph with information about Karl Marx and the communist
viewpoint.</p>

<p>The communist position appealed to Ralph. Here was an
organization that claimed that it was working zealously for the
betterment of the Negro. The propaganda appeals seemed to
point the direction that Ralph should take. He succumbed and
joined the Communist Party. He was to learn that the Party
has no sincere concern for the Negro but was and is using
deceptive propaganda appeals to advance the communist
cause.</p>

<p>The very same communist tactic applies in the field of labor
unions. Edward was an active member of his union. In the
early 1940’s he was recruited into the Communist Party and
assigned to a club in the industrial section of the Party. Why
had he joined? “When I joined the Communist Party I believed
that I was joining a political party that would benefit the
workingman.” Three years later he dropped out of the Party;
it was <i>not</i> for the workingman. Rather it aimed at killing individual
rights, making unions subservient to Party orders, and
using union strength, influence, and finances to further communist
goals.</p>

<p>The Party today is still busily at work trying to infiltrate
unions. Historically, communists, including Lenin, have taught
that communists must infiltrate unions. Every union member
must realize that the communist interest in labor organizations
is insincere. Past communist appeals have been recognized as
false by patriotic union leaders themselves. Today’s communist
appeal is no less false or dangerous than those of previous
years. Our knowledge of how the Party operated in the past is
one of our best weapons in defeating its techniques today.</p>

<p>The list of specific reasons for joining the Party, growing out
of a desire to improve our nation, would be long. One woman
was interested in social problems, such as slum clearance and
better housing. Communists claimed to favor the same things
as she. She believed and joined. Another individual, as a young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
minister, saw many injustices in a Northern state. Still another,
arriving home from overseas, felt that the war had not accomplished
any semblance of peace; he was displeased with
American policy. He walked into Party headquarters on his
own initiative and signed up.</p>

<p>Over the years thousands of Americans have entered the
doors of communism. The turnover of Party membership has
been great. Besides those motivated from idealistic reasons,
there have been curiosity- and adventure-seekers, opportunists,
disgruntled misfits, and power-hungry personalities.
Some of these have consciously sought out the Party; others
have just drifted into it. Many were youngsters, wanting to
dance and sing. Some wanted social companionship. In others,
sexual appeal played a role.</p>

<p>The Party, falsely representing itself as the final answer to
<i>all</i> of society’s problems, economic, social, political, and religious,
makes ready use of the various hopes, fears, and aspirations
of recruits. This dynamic deceit of communist action
provides an immediate channel for energy and enthusiasm.
Within hours a recruit will be handing out leaflets or running
errands. He gets the feeling of being in action <i>now</i> and not
having to wait to participate in the fight for what he conceives
to be a better world. Many recruits to the Party, when asked
later why they didn’t offer their talents to legitimate organizations
concerned with reform, said such groups were “too slow.”
In the Party they found that “immediacy” which so satisfied
them.</p>

<p>Then, in working in the Party, the recruit is promised a
“belongingness,” a feeling of comradeship that can be won
only in day-to-day battles for the greatest of causes. The member
is told that he is part of a world-wide movement based on
the most “enlightened,” “advanced,” and “scientific” principles.
Unfortunately the Party has been able to generate great
enthusiasm through this teaching. One member told the FBI
that the slogan, “vanguard of the working class,” had appealed
to him. He felt that not only was he contributing his own
talents to the cause but he was “leading,” “educating,” and
“guiding” others. “I think this activity was satisfying something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
in me,” another stated. Such an approach often deceives
recruits, especially those of an egotistical nature, who appreciate
the prospect of achieving personal “power” inside the
Party structure where the chief qualification for advancement
is not ability, education, or talent but loyalty to the Party. One
high Party leader whose authority over Party disciplinary matters
extended across half a continent was in ordinary life a
day laborer. The flattering of his ego from his Party position
can well be imagined.</p>

<p>In particular the communists have made an appeal to the
so-called intellectual. The seduction of many intellectuals over
the years by the Party stands as a disgrace. Thinking men and
women, trained to analyze critically, all too often have been
duped.</p>

<p>Our experience has shown that members joining the Party
for idealistic reasons are more likely to stay in the movement
than those not so motivated. Of course, this is not always true.
Though joining the Party in a sincere attempt to better society,
a member may quickly become disillusioned. However, time
after time members who join for curiosity, for social reasons,
or for sexual pleasure soon drift out. They are usually not the
material from which hard-core communists are made. Here is
an example:</p>

<p>Gladys was a college girl, rather gay, not too serious, with a
great deal of leisure. She attended some Marxist study groups.
Here Russia and communism were painted in rosy colors.
After several meetings she was invited to join the Party. She
accepted, 80 per cent, she said, out of curiosity and partly
because she felt that if the communists could achieve a
“peaceful” world about which they talked, it would be a “nice
thing.” Other reasons Gladys gave for joining: to have something
to do and to alleviate “boredom.” She described Party
literature as more amusing than educational. Needless to say,
she did not stay in the movement. Even Party officials, in her
opinion, never seemed to trust her.</p>

<p>A sad group of recruits are simply the twisted, mixed-up
neurotics. Perhaps as sons and daughters of well-to-do parents
they harbor a “guilt complex” about the very privileges that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
America has given them. Or, because of some setback in life,
they are angry at society and turn to communism as a way to
“get even.”</p>

<p>Let’s look at Larry, a communist in a Midwestern state.
Ever since youth, he had felt a “persecution complex.” Everywhere
he looked he seemed to see despair and strife. The
whole of society, he concluded, was strictly a dog-eat-dog
affair, with life being divided between the have’s and the
have-not’s. Such an attitude was intensified by an “artistic”
and “sensitive” temperament. Seeing these “injustices,” he felt
compelled to help the “persecuted.” At first he became just a
“reformer”; then, after reading Marxist literature, he joined
the Party. Twisted, distorted, and maladjusted, he is today
even more confused. He found that the Party only exploited
his neurotic condition to make use of his services.</p>

<p>The techniques of actual recruitment vary. In most instances
indoctrination comes slowly. A fellow union member,
worker, or associate who is a Party member will “work” on
the prospect. First come conversations about mutual interests
such as union activities. Deftly the communist slant will be
emphasized. Perhaps then will come communist literature or
an invitation to a “study group.” Step by step the recruit
becomes enmeshed in the Party’s efficient recruitment apparatus.</p>

<p>A former member told how she first became acquainted
with communism, which she was later to reject. She was living
a lonely life in a boardinghouse. She noticed that some of her
neighbors had many friends who laughed and chattered gaily.
Apparently they had common interests that drew them together.
One night she heard the muffled overtones of what
sounded like a meeting next door: “Overcome by my growing
curiosity about them, I snooped as no lady should. I sat on the
bed and pressed my ear against the plaster wall. As their subdued
voices rose and fell, I caught words and snatches. I don’t
know now what I heard, or what could have convinced me in
my great ignorance of that time. But before the meeting adjourned,
I believed my jolly neighbors were Communists, and
that I was listening to a secret meeting of a Communist cell of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
Government workers! They did not look as Communists were
pictured, and they were not plotting bomb-throwing or assassination,
but some much duller discussion with long words.”
In her loneliness this woman joined the Communist Party but
found neither “happiness” nor a “sense of direction”—only bitter
disappointments.</p>

<p>Party fronts offer excellent means of recruitment. Be assured
that every noncommunist who actively participates in a front
is under the Party’s close scrutiny. Sometimes, of course, as we
have seen, an individual is more useful to the Party by remaining
a nonmember, a sympathizer, or a fellow traveler. At other
times, if the prospect seems to offer a fertile field of recruitment,
pressure is applied. Thousands of Party members were
recruited through the many fronts operating in the 1930’s and
1940’s.</p>

<p>Of special interest to the Party are young people. The
Party’s youth organizations, such as the Young Communist
League and its successors, are largely recruiters of young
people for communism. Many Party-sponsored activities—dances,
parties, and picnics—are aimed to win the allegiance
of boys and girls. Time after time members join as teen-agers—the
age at which the Party would like to capture minds.</p>

<p>Many Party members have been recruited from communist
homes, the children of Party members. In America today many
hundreds of children, growing up in communist homes, are
captives of this alien ideology. These youngsters are taught
from the earliest years that God does not exist. One communist
mother in a Northern state taught her children that God
was not real. She said that it was fun to watch Superman on
TV but that a person must recognize that he doesn’t actually
exist. It’s the same way, she said, with God. In another city a
communist father noticed a religious program on the family
television set. He uttered a derogatory remark and turned off
the program with the exclamation, “I’m a Marxist.”</p>

<p>Party parents provide special Marxist instruction for their
children. One father would sit down with his youngsters and
discuss items appearing in the <i>Daily Worker</i>; another gave
regular quizzes on Marxist literature; still another lectured on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
Marxist economics every morning at the breakfast table. When
the child grows up, he is given Party tasks: distributing literature,
taking up collections at rallies, walking in picket lines.
He begins to get the “feel” of Party life. In one instance a
communist family gathered around a table and spent an hour
or two in Party self-criticism and promising to do better. Party
morality is constantly being inculcated in these youthful
minds, a belief that whatever helps the Party is good, whatever
hinders it is immoral. In one instance a communist father
denounced a federal law that restricted the activities of the
Party. His teen-age son, confused by the statement, pointed
out that the Act was part of the law of the land. “Son,” the
father replied, “if a law is bad, you do not have to obey it.”</p>

<p>No wonder many hundreds of recruits spring from communist
homes as devotees of Marxism-Leninism.</p>

<p>Our experience has shown that reasons for joining the Party
are many, varied, and complicated. Each individual has his
own personal problems, hopes, and aspirations. Any attempt to
apply generalized, ready-made stereotypes is to leave the
problem unsolved. Moreover, we must try to see the <i>total man</i>;
that is, all the forces, events, ideas, and motivations that
brought about his tragic decision. For that reason each member
deserves careful study. In the next chapter I shall discuss
the reasons why members leave the Party. Here again we
must understand each member as a human being, as an individual,
always remembering that even though still a bigoted
devotee he is convertible. Any thinking Party member will
soon recognize the basic contradictions of communism.</p>

<p>We should be alert to help any communist back on the road
to good American citizenship as soon as he shows the slightest
indication that he is disillusioned with what he has found
inside Party circles.</p>

<p>What lesson can we as a society learn from the Party’s
methods of recruitment? Most important, I think, is to realize
that the Communist Party is attempting to exploit the rise of
materialism, irreligion, and lack of faith in our society. In an
era when moral standards have been lowered, when family
life has been disrupted, when crime and juvenile delinquency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
rates are high, communists have tried to set forth a goal—dressed
in attractive phrases—that would captivate the longings
and hopes of men and women. They have, in truth, tried
to “steal” the nobility, the fervor, the enthusiasm of a free
government under God.</p>

<i>Why People Break with Communism</i></h3>

</div>

<p>Just as important as knowing why people join the Communist
Party is understanding why they leave. Here again, by
recognizing the influences that cause them to reject this alien
doctrine, we can do much to defeat the communist conspiracy.</p>

<p>Always we must keep in mind that communists, even hard-core
members, potentially can be converted. To the individual
who asserts, “Once a communist, always a communist,” I say:
“No. Every communist can be made to see the errors of his
way. He must not be despised, belittled, or rejected as hopelessly
lost. He can redeem himself by actively taking a stand
for freedom. Every patriotic American must do what he can
to bring these persons to see the truth. The ex-communist is
today one of our most potent weapons against communism.”</p>

<p>On September 9, 1957, the <i>Daily Worker</i> published a story
which stated: “Joseph Clark has resigned from the Daily
Worker, of which he was foreign editor, and from membership
in the Communist Party.”</p>

<p>Clark was a Party member for twenty-eight years, always
known as an ardent one. When Stalin died, Clark was his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
paper’s correspondent in Moscow. Yet, by his own current
processes of thinking he saw the futility of the Party.</p>

<p>Howard Fast, well-known communist author, was mentioned
in the last chapter. After years of Party membership
and thousands of words of communist propaganda, he quit.
The revelations of Khrushchev about Stalin’s murderous
regime were too much. “The dimensions of this horror were
not only beyond anything we could have dreamed of ... I
was filled with loathing and disgust.”</p>

<p>On the West Coast Barbara Hartle, because of her fiery
energy and zeal, was recognized in Party circles as the outstanding
woman communist in the Pacific Northwest. So active
was she in Party circles that she was indicted, tried, and
convicted under the Smith Act. But she, too, became disillusioned.
Like Louis Budenz, Bella Dodd, Howard Fast, and
Joseph Clark, she added her name to the growing list of
communists who have said, “We’ve had enough. We’re quitting.”</p>

<p>To understand why members break with the Party, let’s examine
the case of Barbara Hartle, who exemplifies the anguish
of a Party official desperately seeking her way to freedom.
Her experiences may enable members still in the Party
to look into their own hearts. Are they being beset by the
same doubts? Why have these doubts arisen? What is working
to increase or to quell them?</p>

<p>On the other hand, Barbara Hartle’s story will give the
patriotic citizen an appreciation of the anguish experienced
by Party members on their journey to freedom. He can learn
to be understanding, patient, and helpful. He will see, for instance,
how a sympathetic citizen helped Barbara free herself
from communist entanglement.</p>

<p>On March 12, 1954, Barbara Hartle walked into the Seattle
office of the FBI. She didn’t need to identify herself. The previous
October she, along with four other top Party leaders,
had been convicted in Seattle under the Smith Act.</p>

<p>Barbara Hartle told her story: She had been graduated in
1929, Phi Beta Kappa, from Washington State College, majoring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
in English; then she went to Spokane, trying to find a job.
Those were depression days and her story is all too typical.
Hoping for a “better world,” she began to read Karl Marx.
Deeply impressed, she joined the Socialist, then the Communist,
Party. Her rise was rapid. Later she was transferred to
Seattle where she occupied some of the highest Party positions
in the Washington State organization. “I’ll go to jail if I
must,” she once declared, “but I’ll remain a communist.”</p>

<p>One day in 1945 Barbara Hartle sat writing an article for
the communist press. Earl Browder was on his way out as
head of the communist movement. By force of habit she defended
him. But Party experience taught otherwise. Foster
was now the “boss.” Confused by the sudden Party shift, she
tore up the article.</p>

<p>Later, back on the Party line, she wrote another article
supporting Foster. But something had happened. Out of this
confusion, this “great surprise,” as she termed it, of the Party
switch, she seemed suddenly to have seen something new—that
the Party was not what it claimed to be, but a fraudulent
deception. To Barbara Hartle, as to many communists,
doubt had come, an indication that the breath of freedom
was still alive in her.</p>

<p>As in many such cases, this confusion and doubt quickly
disappeared, swallowed up in the rush of Party life. In 1939
she had become disturbed by the Party’s position on the Hitler-Stalin
pact, but this also had passed. She soon became the
same fanatical Barbara Hartle, attending meetings, issuing
orders, making speeches.</p>

<p>Yet these doubts were to be followed by other doubts. Now
she began, as she later explained, to become conscious of certain
features of Party life that she had not previously noticed.
She listed some of them:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. The constant factional struggle for leadership.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. The hand-picking of leaders from the top.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. The arbitrary handling of funds by some of the top officials.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Finding the “self-criticism” of leaders to be mere “empty
promises.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p class="hanging">5. The “furious resistance” of Party leaders to criticism or
guidance offered by rank-and-file members.</p>

<p class="hanging">6. The expulsion of members by “rigged trials.”</p>

</div>

<p>Like a searchlight, these doubts began to search out other
doubts, inconsistencies, and contradictions. The fissure of
doubt was widening.</p>

<p>Now Barbara was to experience a phenomenon that affects
every Party member trying to break the communist spell: <i>the
counterattack of the unconscious Party discipline</i>.</p>

<p>Doubts would suddenly arise, then disappear. They would
arise again but again disappear. When she seemed to want to
slow up in her Party work, her old enthusiasm would return.
She found, as she later explained, that her “process of mental
reorientation was impeded by the study and teaching of
Marxist-Leninist works, which is the Communist Party’s antidote
for such an eventuality.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Over a long period and through a slow process of constant discussion,
schools, and self study the Communist Party builds a
conscience of responsibility upon which it then relies to keep
a member functioning, even though any real desire to do so
has passed.</p>

</div>

<p>That’s why the Party keeps stressing Marxist-Leninist education:
Party schools, reading the communist press, self-study.
It builds up a discipline that automatically attacks doubts,
rationalizes contradictions inside the Party structure, and
guides every decision in the Party’s favor.</p>

<p>Then, in mid-1950, an important event occurred for Barbara
Hartle. She received instructions to attend a secret meeting in
Woodland Park, Seattle. There she was told to change her
name, leave Seattle, and enter the Party’s underground. For
the next two years she lived under assumed names in various
Washington State and Oregon cities.</p>

<p>The unending hustle and bustle of everyday Party activity
ceased. As she sat in a lonely room or stood on a dark street
corner waiting for an underground meeting, she now had time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
to think. Suddenly all the doubts that had been slowly accumulating
came together. At the same time the restraining
influences of Party discipline became weaker.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">A more rapid disillusionment on my part took place when I
left the active Communist Party upon leaving Seattle to enter
the Communist Party underground movement. Without
direct day to day pressure, with less reading of Marxist-Leninist
works and with increased reading of other material, and
through coming into contact with average people my mental
processes were hastened. The culmination of this process was
my decision to leave the Communist Party and to live my own
life.</p>

</div>

<p>She became convinced that the Communist Party was an
evil; that it did not represent a way to better social or
economic conditions; that it was a fraud and a deception.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">I never realized that this discipline and this mental and physical
domination of the Communist Party over its members is
necessary to it in order to continue its double life of posing
as one thing and being another. I had never before realized
that the many unsolved problems I had noted while still a
Communist Party member were products of this double existence.</p>

</div>

<p>It was one thing, however, to break intellectually with the
Party, another to break openly. That was now to be Barbara
Hartle’s anguish and the anguish of so many members still in
the Party today.</p>

<p>Barbara was living in a no-man’s land: she had broken with
the world of tyranny yet was held by the power that had
robbed her of freedom. The indecision began to tear her apart.
She was spiritually sick. At first she kept saying to herself and
the Party, “I’ll be all right. Just give me a little time. I’ll work
this out.” She just couldn’t realize that these doubts were
permanent signs of a new life, not temporary confusions in an
old allegiance. Merely to drift away quietly wasn’t possible.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
The Party wouldn’t allow that. The only way was to redeem
herself by walking boldly forward.</p>

<p>This she did in March, 1954. And here is what a sympathetic
citizen can do to help. Mr. Traynor Hansen, a reporter for
the Seattle <i>Post-Intelligencer</i>, had covered the 1953 Seattle
Smith Act trial. He noticed, as did others, that Barbara Hartle
lacked the fiery disposition of the other defendants. Later,
while on bond, she had long visits with him. It was his counsel
that she go to the FBI since it would have been improper
under the circumstances for us to go to her.</p>

<p>To Barbara Hartle’s lasting credit, she did not try to evade
responsibilities for her past errors. The information that she
furnished the FBI is now at work against the very Party that
for almost twenty years duped her. And she, with a clear conscience,
is winning back the respect and esteem she had before
the Party stole her away. She deserves aid as she reconstructs
her life.</p>

<p>Many interviews with Party members reflect numerous men
and women inside the movement today in various stages of
disillusionment. Such doubts are good omens. They indicate
that not all members are lost beyond recall. By the very nature
of Party discipline doubts are inevitable. Any member in the
Party today without doubts is indeed a complete slave.</p>

<p>What causes doubt to arise in the minds of members? Our
experiences reveal these major categories:</p>

<p class="tb">1. <i>The absence of freedom inside the Party.</i> The greatest
single factor making for doubt is the lack of democracy inside
the Party. “I was constantly whipped into line,” one member
said, “on policies and issues with which I disagreed.” “Discussions
at meetings were not open....” Party organizers
would come and tell the club what to do. “Why Writer Quit
Reds: They Frown on Thinking,” read a headline in a New
York City newspaper. This member could no longer force
himself “to live in the stifling atmosphere of the party line with
all its ruthless intolerance for the processes of the mind.” In
another instance a woman told us how she had voted “no”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
in a Party meeting. “People literally moved their chairs away
from me. I walked out of the meeting and never attended a
Communist Party meeting again.”</p>

<p>More and more intellectuals are realizing that the Party is
simply exploiting their prestige and talents, without trusting
them. Intellectuals are encouraged to think, if they think the
“right” way; but any independent thinking is not allowed.
That is why, in the final analysis, the Party keeps the pressure
on its members who are intellectuals. It fears that they might
start thinking for themselves. As one intellectual stated, “I
think that the Party was using me, as they were many other
intellectuals.... I always had the feeling that they never
trusted intellectuals beyond a certain limit....”</p>

<p class="tb">2. <i>The inability to live a normal life.</i> Closely allied is the
impossibility of living as a decent human being. One member
said he resented the Party’s constantly demanding his time.
There was no end of assignments: distributing literature, attending
meetings, getting petitions signed. Another member
complained that she was “sick and tired” of her husband’s
putting the Party before her and the children. The Party’s instructions
must always take precedence. This constant stealing
of time, never allowing the member to relax, develop a hobby,
or enjoy a family, provokes the most searching doubts.</p>

<p class="tb">3. <i>The Party’s callous disregard of members’ personal problems.</i>
A Party official’s wife was sick. He asked for time off. It
was refused. Or, a member’s home must be mortgaged in a
fund drive. And if he cannot make payments, it’s his hard luck.
Again, an old-time member was sent underground. He was
instructed to change his name, sell his car and personal belongings,
leave his wife and not contact her. He asked Party
permission to visit his family. The answer: no. He came home
anyhow and was severely disciplined.</p>

<p>No wonder more and more members are asking, “Why
continue to be exploited?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p class="tb">4. <i>Discrepancy between Party practices and claims.</i> As we
have seen, many members join in the mistaken belief that the
Party will improve some social evil, such as racial inequality
or inadequate housing. “It is frankly recognized in Communist
theory,” one disillusioned old-timer confessed, “that the whole
strategy is not for the main purpose of Negro liberation, but
for the purpose of the proletarian revolution.” “My dissatisfaction
with the Party and my break with the Party came about
through a gradual process as a result of the realization that
Party policy was a detriment to true trade unionism.”</p>

<p>Like Barbara Hartle, dubious communists see the internal
squabbles and feuds, rigged elections, trumped-up evidence,
the striving to be little commissars. Party leaders stay in fancy
hotels or take vacations, while rank-and-file members are
hounded to donate the last dollar. All this is disillusioning,
especially in an organization that claims to be working for a
just society.</p>

<p class="tb">5. <i>Communist tyranny in Russia and behind the Iron Curtain.</i>
The sensational revelations of Khrushchev concerning
the crimes of Stalin rocked the Party apparatus. Then came
indisputable evidence of anti-Semitism in Russia and in
November, 1956, the capping blow, suppression of Hungary
by Soviet troops, the spectacle of a self-proclaimed leader of
“people’s rights” physically strangling a people’s demand for
liberty.</p>

<p>This caused Howard Fast to strike violently at the Party
that could give birth to “the explosive and hellish revelations
of the Khrushchev ‘secret report’” when he said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">I felt a sense of unmitigated mental nausea at the realization
that I had supported and defended this murderous bloodbath,
and I felt, as so many did then, a sense of being a victim of
the most incredible swindle in modern times.</p>

</div>

<p>About Hungary: “From Hungary and its tragedy we learned
of a new kind of socialism—socialism by slaughter and terror.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
No wonder Fast laments, “A lifelong structure of belief lies
shattered around me....”</p>

<p>Another member who had been in the Party almost twenty
years told our agents that she was quitting. If what happened
in Russia, as revealed by Khrushchev, was true, she wanted
“no part” of it. Still another member with over twenty-five
years in the movement admitted that Soviet intervention in
Hungary brought things to a head for him. If he were in
Hungary, he said, he would be a Freedom Fighter.</p>

<p>Every abrupt change in the Party line, such as the 1939
Hitler-Stalin Pact or the 1945 ousting of Browder, jars many
members. However, no event in Party life has been so conducive
to raising doubts among members as the Khrushchev
report and its sequel.</p>

<p class="tb">6. <i>Communist opposition to religion.</i> Member after member
has related that the Party’s claims that God doesn’t exist and
that religion is a myth have raised doubts. Many members
carry within their hearts the influence of religious training
received while they were young. They inwardly rebel at a
materialist solution to life.</p>

<p>Then there is the protest against the Marxist doctrine,
which, in the words of one former member, “purports to reduce
man’s problems and destiny to an economic formula.” In
deeply emotional terms he added, “I want my children to approach
their world and the history behind it, with the curiosity
and objectivity it takes to learn. I do not want them to feel
that the questions are answered, that this or that little system
is the slide rule for answering all their questions.”</p>

<p>These, then, are some of the reasons why doubts concerning
communism arise in members’ minds. Why do many still
hesitate to break with the Party? The answer: They are still
under the influence of false fears.</p>

<p class="tb">1. <i>Fear of the FBI.</i> One member, when interviewed by the
FBI, expressed amazement at the cordial treatment accorded
him. “I thought you fellows would drag me from my house.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
Communists for years have poured scorn and contempt on the
FBI. They try to paint our agents as brutal thugs in the hope
of driving a wedge between their members and the government.
One highly placed member, visited by the FBI, turned
what was expected to be a fifteen-minute interview into a five-hour
discussion, during which he said, “The Party considers
the FBI its prime enemy and Party members are expected to
denounce the FBI.” The FBI wants sincerely to help these individuals.
They should feel free to counsel with us. Members
can be assured that they will be cordially received, not embarrassed,
and that their information will be kept strictly
confidential, should they so request or if there is good reason
to protect their identity.</p>

<p class="tb">2. <i>Fear of being a “stool pigeon.”</i> This false belief, inspired
by Party discipline, is today keeping many lost souls silent.
Our agents asked one Party member, “Suppose a criminal
gang kidnaped one of your children. What would you do?”
The answer: “Call the FBI.” “Would you want the FBI to
make inquiries to locate the youngster?” “Yes.” “Would you
expect citizens having pertinent knowledge of this criminal
conspiracy to give that information to the FBI?” “Certainly,”
he said.</p>

<p>The communist member furnishing information to the FBI
is also doing his moral and patriotic duty in helping crush a
criminal conspiracy. To remain silent is to assist the Party.
Communism, like a criminal gang, thrives when people able
to combat it refuse to do so. “Stool pigeon” is a Party-defined
term used as a weapon to enforce communist discipline. The
Party is enabled to reach into men’s minds, censor their
thoughts and words, and thereby buttress tyranny.</p>

<p class="tb">3. <i>Fear of personal safety and reputation.</i> Some members
fear the rabid hatred that the Party spews out at members
leaving the movement. A West Coast communist, though disillusioned,
didn’t break with the Party. He feared that his
communist friends would ostracize him. Finally, though hesitantly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
he said he was now willing to “risk” being with the
majority of Americans!</p>

<p>Party members should not fear the hostility of their former
Party associates. To be denounced by communists is an honor.
Remember, the example of a Party member breaking with the
Party may influence others to do likewise.</p>

<p class="tb">4. <i>Fear of disgracing their families.</i> Many members trapped
in the Party dread that their loved ones will know of their
involvement. One man, asked if his wife and children knew of
his communist background, began to cry. Another said he
would do anything to keep his young son from knowing. Not
long ago our agents contacted a Party member. “Don’t talk to
me at home,” she said. “I don’t want the children to know.
Call me on the phone.” Her wishes were respected.</p>

<p>To remain silent is not to improve the situation. There is no
way in which such cooperation will injure the family. One
member, very thankful that he had cooperated with the FBI,
said he was happily married and simply would not allow his
communist background to injure his innocent family.</p>

<p class="tb">5. <i>Fear of not being received as a loyal American.</i> The answer
lies largely with the Party member himself. It is within
his power alone to break completely with communism. He
will be judged by his actions, not alone by his words. The
biblical advice holds true: “... by their fruits ye shall know
them.”</p>

<p>In addition, patriotic Americans must do their share to help
these Party members. Many are driven back into Party tyranny
by the inexcusable ignorance, rancor, and pride of noncommunists.
Moreover, it does not help when the truly reformed communist
is characterized as a “renegade” and “traitor”—terms
which would normally be used by communists themselves and
not by good Americans.</p>

<p>In November, 1953, I wrote an article entitled “Breaking
the Communist Spell,” which appeared in <i>This Week</i> magazine.
It was an appeal to members disillusioned with communism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
to step forward and help in the fight against Soviet
tyranny. The response was encouraging. In an Eastern city a
caller said he had read the article and wanted to give information
about Party activities. Another person told our agents,
“It’s never easy to tell such a story.... Then I saw an appeal
by J. Edgar Hoover in a recent magazine article and after
reading it several times felt that I should make a special effort
to remember and pull what I could into order.”</p>

<p>I want to set forth again the salient portions of this article.
It seems to sum up what we have been trying to say on this
most important subject:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The individual contributions of former members of the Communist
Party to the security of our way of life are shining examples
of people who have recognized their mistakes and are
doing all within their power to rectify them.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>If, having knowledge of persons and activities detrimental
to his country, he breaks from the Party, yet maintains silence,
he is still aiding the enemy. The moral obligation involved
cannot be met by silence. The choice is simple: <i>help the
United States</i>. The man who does this is preserving freedom
under law. He is protecting the American way of life for free
men and women—including his family and himself.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>These people deserve the nation’s respect, and their neighbors’
fair-minded forgiveness for their past devotion to Communism.
Their means of livelihood must be protected, and
loyal Americans must accept their sincere repentance as a return
to the full scope of citizenship. All great religions teach
that the sinner can always redeem himself. Who, then, shall
sit in judgment on the ex-Communist? Who dare deny him
the promise held out to those who repent of the evil they have
done and who try to make amends?</p>

<p>For our part, at the FBI, we have always sought to recognize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
the very real human and personal problems facing the
ex-Communists who have come to our offices to make such
amends....</p>

<p>In discussing the ex-Communist, those who piously say that
the leopard never changes its spots forget that they are speaking
of human beings—mortal creatures with immortal souls.
And those who say “Once a Communist, always a Communist”
are simply advertising their ignorance. To deny that men can
change is to deny the truths which have eternally guided
civilized man.</p>

<i>How the Party Is Organized</i></h3>

</div>

<p>Look in for a minute on a typical secret meeting of a communist
“club” or cell “somewhere in the United States.” This
particular meeting is selected because it is typical of hundreds
of such meetings.</p>

<p>The house is frame, painted gray with green shutters. A
wire fence runs around the trim yard. The owner works as a
draftsman in a downtown company, his wife keeps house. They
have lived in the neighborhood for many years.</p>

<p>It is now dark, a little after eight o’clock on a winter evening.
The downstairs light is on, the blinds are drawn. A man
comes to the front door, raps lightly, and is admitted. Soon
another man, walking at a leisurely pace, rounds the corner
and enters. He has parked his car on another street.</p>

<p>Ten minutes pass. A third man knocks. He has come by bus
from downtown. To make certain nobody was following him,
he had ridden two stops past his correct destination, then
walked back. Five minutes later a fourth person, a woman in
a dark coat, arrives. Everything is quiet: no loud voices, no
cars parked in front, no reasons for the neighbors to suspect
that a Communist Party meeting is in progress.</p>

<p>Communist Party groups like this are small, containing
three, four, or five people—a security precaution. In that way
fewer members know each other and detection is less likely.
Meeting places are frequently changed: this evening a private
home, next time a public library or an automobile. Members
have been known to sit on park benches, in bus terminals, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
in hospital waiting rooms, hatching their plots in casual, conversational
tones.</p>

<p>The third man is the Party organizer, a paid official who
serves as the group’s leader. He sits in a chair in the corner;
the others form a rough semicircle. He speaks quietly but in a
commanding tone, acting the dictator that he actually is.</p>

<p>“Joe,” he says, addressing the first man to arrive, “you remember
the last time we met you were given an assignment
to collect three to five thousand sheets of paper, a Mimeograph
machine, and some ink. How did things go?”</p>

<p>“Fine,” Joe replies. “I bought four thousand sheets of paper.
Got them at three different stores.”</p>

<p>“Good,” says the organizer, “that’s using your head.”</p>

<p>“I also bought a Mimeograph machine and plenty of ink.
Everything’s safe now in the right place.” (The “right place”
refers to an apartment in another section of the city occupied
by a concealed communist, which the Party uses as a secret
hide-out.)</p>

<p>“One thing more,” Joe says. “I’ve made inquiries about a
portable printing press. It’s pretty old, but it’ll work.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” the organizer says, obviously pleased. “Follow that
through. You took the serial numbers off the Mimeograph,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” stammers the comrade. “I forgot....”</p>

<p>“Forgot!” explodes the organizer. “What’s wrong with you?
That’s just plain stupid. Joe, this is serious business. You’ve
got to keep alert. Someday this machine may be used to print
secret Party instructions. We can’t afford to have it traced.
Take off all identification marks at once.”</p>

<p>Then turning to another man, the one who had parked his
car around the corner, the organizer says, “Phil, how are
things coming at the plant? Making any progress on getting
Bill installed as shop steward?”</p>

<p>“No, not much. Things look pretty bad.” The man shifts
his legs. He is a big fellow, weighing over two hundred
pounds. “Looks like we’re blocked.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” snaps the organizer, “we’ve gone over that
before. There’s always a way. Communists never give up.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
You’ve got things good. You’re at home enjoying life. Remember
Lenin, exiled from Russia, going from town to town. He
didn’t quit, and look what he did. He was a genius. What’s
the big problem, Phil?”</p>

<p>“It’s Red, the union president. He knows Bill is a communist
and he’s fighting him. Red is smart, he knows the ropes.
He’s always been a hard worker for labor unions. He’s got a
clean record and he’s liked by the members. As long as Red is
president, we’re in a bad fix.”</p>

<p>“That’s the wrong attitude, Phil. If one thing won’t work, try
another. Can’t we accuse him of something? Have you gone
over his past life? Hasn’t he ever done anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“If he has, we can’t find it. He’s a straight shooter from ’way
back and he really hates communists.”</p>

<p>“Phil, this is your Number One assignment,” the organizer
says. “You get something on Red. He’s got to be discredited.
Maybe we can make up some letters, mail them in another
city, accuse him of working against the union. You figure out
the details.”</p>

<p>The organizer goes around the circle to the other members.
Are they carrying out their assignments? Ethel, the draftsman’s
wife, thinks she will soon be elected an officer in a
downtown women’s group.</p>

<p>“Wonderful,” says the organizer. “Don’t rush things too fast
but try to get some of the women to write letters to Washington.
Let them say the FBI is a Gestapo; that they’re violating
civil liberties by arresting Party leaders. That’s good, Ethel.”</p>

<p>“They haven’t the slightest idea I’m a communist.” She
laughs. “I’m working hard at it.” The other woman, the last
one to arrive, reports her activities as secretary of a communist-front
organization.</p>

<p>The organizer, wanting the meeting to be short, speaks a
few words about “new things” in the Party: A pamphlet from
national headquarters has just been received and should be
bought by all; finances are not in good shape; a new Party
school is going to be held next month. Ethel should attend.</p>

<p>Shortly after nine o’clock the meeting is over, and as quietly
as they have come the members slip out into the night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>This Communist Party club is representative of many hundreds
throughout the nation. Night after night, week after
week, these men and women are plotting against America,
working out smears, seeking to discredit free government, and
planning for revolution. They form the base of a gigantic
pyramid of treason, stretching from the little gray house with
green shutters to the towers of the Kremlin.</p>

<h4>The Communist Constitution (18th version, 1957)</h4>

<p>At least in theory the Communist Party, USA, is based on
a “constitution,” which sets forth the group’s organizational
structure. That constitution, being a public document, is
filled with typical Aesopian language. The Party member, for
example, isn’t fooled when the constitution proclaims, “The
Communist Party upholds the achievements of American
democracy and defends the United States Constitution and
its Bill of Rights....” He knows better. His Marxist training
enables him to recognize the Party’s real aim:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The Communist Party seeks to advance the understanding of
the working class in its day-to-day struggles for its historic
mission, the establishment of socialism. (Preamble)</p>

</div>

<p>Here is the key, “<i>historic mission</i>.” What does it mean? Not
something traditional, respectable, or patriotic, but the overthrow
of this government by force and violence. Engels talked
about the “historic mission” of “the proletariat,” which “can
only free itself by doing away once for all with class dominion,
subjugation, and exploitation.” That, in communist terminology,
means revolution. The Communist International spoke of
the Party’s “historic mission of achieving the dictatorship of
the proletariat.”</p>

<p>Today’s communists, with deceitful double talk, are attempting
to camouflage the true meaning of this old and
well-defined revolutionary term. Comrades in the early 1920’s
weren’t quite so squeamish about their intentions. The Party’s
constitution (1921) proclaimed the communist purpose:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... to destroy the bourgeois state machinery; to establish the
Dictatorship of the Proletariat in the form of Soviet power; to
abolish the capitalist system and to introduce the Communist
Society. (Article I, Section 2)</p>

</div>

<p>Regardless of current communist claims, “historic mission”
is the Party’s linguistic description of its revolutionary intent.</p>

<p>The National Convention, according to the constitution, is
the highest authority in the Party. This convention, normally
held every two years, is composed of delegates “elected” by
state or district conventions. The National Convention, after
hearing “discussions” of the various issues, is authorized to
make decisions binding upon the entire membership.</p>

<p>These affairs have the trappings of big-time conventions.
Various committees are chosen, resolutions adopted, and
speeches given. Proceedings are secret, although communists
say they have nothing to hide. Members of the legitimate press
are excluded. Exploiting this blackout of news, the communists
often issue slanted press releases in an effort to influence
public opinion. Another tactic is to allow the attendance of
selected noncommunists, persons carefully hand-picked wherever
possible, who the Party hopes will later make favorable
reports.</p>

<p>Extensive preparations are made for the National Convention.
Party officials as a general rule work up a “draft
program,” a summary of proposed Party aims on current
issues, national and international. This “draft program” is
widely circulated, with members being asked to discuss indicated
approaches. Then, theoretically, the convention, based
on the opinions developed, adopts a final program. Actually,
in practice, the draft program represents a technique whereby
the leadership “sells” the membership the ideas it wants to
stress. Frequently, convention reports, resolutions, and
speeches, properly edited, are later published. They serve as
policy guides for the membership.</p>

<p>Never forgotten are Soviet trimmings. Proudly read on the
floor of the Sixteenth National Convention (February 9-12,
1957) were greetings from the Central Committee of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Other Communist
Parties in China, Canada, Italy, Japan, and Czechoslovakia
also sent “best wishes.” From these, members gain a sense of
communist solidarity, or, in Party language, <i>proletarian internationalism</i>,
the feeling that they are integral parts of the
world-wide communist movement. This is one of the driving
forces of modern-day communism: the Party-promoted idea
that no member is alone, that he is part of a vast movement
which, in communist eyes, is destined to conquer the world.
Singing the “Internationale,” the communist marching song,
also engenders this feeling.</p>

<h4>The Three Levels of Power</h4>

<p>The Party’s organizational structure may be likened to
layers in a pyramid, one placed on top of the other.</p>

<p>1. The top level centers around national headquarters and
contains the Party’s policy-making organs (1) <i>National Committee</i>;
(2) <i>National Executive Committee</i>; and (3) <i>National
Administrative Committee</i>. With ruthless hand this echelon
rules the Communist Party, USA. The designation given here
is the current arrangement, which is always subject to change.
The Party never hesitates to reshuffle its top administrative
bodies, changing their names and sizes. For many years, for
example, it had national officers: National Chairman, William
Z. Foster, and General Secretary, Earl Browder and, later,
Eugene Dennis. The power remains, however, in the hands of
a small minority.</p>

<p>2. The second or middle level contains the many administrative
organs that implement the decisions of the inner
hierarchy: (1) <i>various commissions and departments</i>; (2)
<i>special organizers</i>; and (3) <i>front groups</i>.</p>

<p>3. The bottom or third level is broad and extensive and
contains all the subordinate regional and local units in the
Party: that is, <i>district organizations</i>, and, in turn, various <i>state</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
<i>county</i>, <i>city</i>, <i>section</i>, and <i>club</i> setups. This level encompasses
the entire nation.</p>

<p>National headquarters is located in a three-story, twenty-foot-wide,
brownstone building at 23 West 26th Street, New
York City, just off Broadway. A pygmy amid Manhattan’s
towering skyscrapers, with iron bars shielding the bottom-floor
windows, this American Kremlin is the symbol of communist
power in our country. Here meetings are held and important
decisions made. The national office occupies the third floor and
penthouse; the New York State Communist Party is on the
first and second floors. However, the 1957 Party convention
authorized shifting national offices to Chicago.</p>

<h4>Level 1: The High Command</h4>

<p>The real power of the Party rests in the <i>National Committee</i>.
This committee, “elected” by the national and state
conventions, is responsible for running the Party between
conventions as provided by the constitution:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Between National Conventions, the National Committee is the
highest authority of the Party, representing the Party as a
whole, and as such has the authority to make decisions and
take actions necessary and incidental to the good and welfare
of the entire Party, and to act upon all problems and developments
occurring between Conventions. (Article V, Section 9)</p>

</div>

<p>This provision covers a multitude of possibilities and forms
the basis for the dictatorship of a few leaders, in typical communist
style. The National Committee is America’s Politburo,
a small group of some sixty individuals directing war against
noncommunist institutions.</p>

<p>Minority control is strengthened still more by clever manipulation.
The current National Committee elected a twenty-member
National Executive Committee, which in turn selected
administrative officials. In actual practice, the latter group is
the dominant power, making day-to-day decisions. There is
no free election of the membership. With members of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
National Committee spread throughout the country, “on-the-spot”
New York comrades tend to monopolize control of
Party affairs.</p>

<p>This atmosphere of almost unlimited authority often produces
a repugnant type of person. Many of the top leaders are
haughty, swaggering, overbearing. They feel that they are
better than “little” comrades. They are the “experts” in
Marxism-Leninism. Their job is to teach the “less informed.”</p>

<p>William Z. Foster went to Seattle, Washington, a few years
ago to make a speech. “We’re glad you’ve come,” the welcoming
local official commented. “Many of our comrades are
looking forward to meeting you.”</p>

<p>“Not so fast,” warned Foster. “I’m not going to see any of
them. I’m too busy. These little Party people just sit down
and pour out their personal problems. It wears me out and
you can’t get rid of them.”</p>

<p>“But,” protested the local organizer, “they’ve been busy for
weeks, working to make the meeting a success. They
want....”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” snapped Foster. “You decide which ones are
worth my time and I’ll see them. Make appointments. I can’t
solve everybody’s problems.”</p>

<p>Later the local leader told Foster that the comrades wanted
to give him a present, perhaps a traveling bag.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” Foster interrupted. “I’ve already looked at traveling
bags, and I didn’t find any costing less than seventy-five
dollars which would be suitable. I don’t think the members
want to spend that much.”</p>

<p>Right he was. The organizer had probably browbeaten all
“volunteers” to collect twenty to thirty dollars.</p>

<p>“What about a watch?” inquired the local leader, intent on
pleasing the high-ranking visitor.</p>

<p>“I already have one,” replied Foster. “It cost a hundred and
twenty-five dollars. I don’t think it’s advisable to buy a more
expensive one, and I wouldn’t wear a cheaper one.”</p>

<p>That settled it. This “proletarian” leader, the “champion of
the poor and downtrodden,” acting like a miniature Hitler,
was indeed difficult to please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<h4>Level 2: The Special Units</h4>

<p>The attack weapons of the Communist Party are contained
in the middle layer, the <i>commissions</i> and <i>departments</i> to carry
out the decisions of the inner clique.</p>

<p>Communist leaders view American life not as a vast, uniform
whole but as a series of different segments, each, in its
own way, open to the appeal of communism. There are, for
instance, farmers with their special problems, trade-union
members, and groups with special interests related to nationality,
youth, and race. Communists realize that a single
program, slanted to appeal to all groups at once, will not work.
To be effective, communist propaganda must be tailored to
fit specific problems. What are a group’s dissatisfactions, desires,
and aims? How can communism most effectively appeal
to this group? The fact that programs designed for different
groups are often mutually contradictory makes no difference
to communists. The main point is to attract followers and stir
up discontent in as many areas as possible.</p>

<p>This is the task of various commissions and departments,
each headed by a national Party leader. Merely to list some of
them will give an idea of the scope of the Communist Party’s
appeal: Veterans’ Commission, Women’s Commission, Education
Department, Cultural Commission, Negro Commission,
Labor Department, Nationality Groups Commission, Youth
Commission.</p>

<p>In addition, there are related organs dealing with the internal
administration of the Party. The National Organization
Department, for example, handles the placement of Party
officials throughout the nation, while the National Review
(Control) Commission (also known as the Appeals Commission)
is in charge of security and disciplinary matters.</p>

<p>These commissions and departments are little dynamos attempting
to spark enthusiasm for the communist cause in their
special fields. They prepare literature, arrange speaking tours,
organize fronts. Their job is to work out the practical details
of implementing the Party line.</p>

<p>This task is accomplished largely through the employment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
of “experts,” men and women trained in special fields. There
are experts of all kinds, on both local and national levels:
waterfront organizers specializing in seamen’s groups; labor
organizers interested in penetrating labor unions; organizers in
virtually every other field, such as aircraft, mining, steel, agriculture,
youth, nationality groups. Then there are fund raisers,
recruiters, Marxist teachers, organizational experts.</p>

<p>If a Party district is planning, let us say, a special organizing
drive, an expert from national headquarters or another district
may arrive to assume charge. He may deal with top officials
or descend to club levels. He may stay a few hours, a week, or
even months. John Williamson for many years was considered
one of the Party’s top labor experts. Henry Winston was an
authority on organizational problems. Both Williamson and
Winston were convicted under the Smith Act; Williamson
later accepted voluntary deportation to Great Britain and has
since been reported to have served as liaison between the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the United States
Party.</p>

<p>If the visitor is a high national officer, special arrangements
are usually made to receive him with “extreme cordiality.” If
his schedule is crowded, a rank-and-filer may be assigned as a
chauffeur. Never must the Party be regarded as a “desk-type”
organization, operating only through letters, telegrams, and
phone calls. It is a fast, hard-hitting, mobile organization,
based primarily on personal contacts, with its officials traveling
thousands of miles a year by auto, train, and air to pursue
subversive activities.</p>

<h4>Level 3: Regional and Local Units</h4>

<p>This layer provides the broad base for the pyramid and includes
the remainder of the Party structure. The United States
is divided into Communist Party districts, some of which have
jurisdiction over more than one state. The Ohio State Communist
Party, directed principally from Cleveland, Ohio, for
example, includes the states of Ohio and Kentucky and West
Virginia’s four northern “panhandle” counties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>Communist membership is strongest in the Northeast section
of the United States. The greatest concentration of Communist
Party members is in the area of New York City. Other
states having large numbers of communists are California,
Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Washington, Connecticut,
Michigan, and Massachusetts. Few members, relatively
speaking, reside in Southern and Rocky Mountain states.</p>

<p>District (or state) organizations, patterned on the national
structure, hold periodic conventions, “elect” state committees,
and have officers. Hence there is a Chairman, New York State
Communist Party, or Secretary, Ohio State Communist Party.
Sometimes state conventions are held in “split sessions”: the
first, before the National Convention when selected topics,
such as those proposed in the “draft program,” are “discussed”;
the second, after the national meeting when the state convention
reassembles to ratify the decisions of the national body.
State leaders take no chances, they stay on the Party line.</p>

<p>Many states and districts have open headquarters. In recent
years most were closed, but the Party realizes that an open
headquarters is essential in carrying out its day-to-day agitational
work. These Party offices are usually located downtown
in a dingy room or suite in an old building. Battered desks,
with typewriter, Mimeograph machine (the good right arm of
the Party), and perhaps a literature rack are standard equipment.
Here are the offices of the state chairman, state secretary,
and other officers. An old-time communist, usually a
woman, will “triple” as receptionist, stenographer, and Mimeograph
operator. Knowing all the members, she’s a good “lookout”
and can answer most questions: Has Oscar come back
from vacation? Where does Joyce work? Is Ruth a club chairman?</p>

<p>Normally, headquarters is a busy place, with people going
in and out all day long. Here special state, county, and city
meetings are held as well as personal conferences. The busiest
items in the place are chairs; they seldom have a rest until
after midnight.</p>

<p>The local organizational structure, under state (or district)
headquarters, varies from area to area. The city (or county)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
sections in turn are subdivided. Intracity sections may encompass
several wards, each, like the county, having its own
set of officers. Each section, of course, is rigidly controlled
from the top.</p>

<p>The basic unit, at the bottom of the whole structure, is the
<i>club</i>, formerly known as the cell, like the one described at the
beginning of this chapter. Clubs are of various types: <i>community
clubs</i>, comprising members who live in a certain
geographical area; <i>shop clubs</i>, composed of members who
work at a certain company; <i>industrial clubs</i>, which include
members employed in the same basic industry, such as steel,
automobile, aluminum, though working for different industrial
firms; and <i>specialized clubs</i>, appealing to professions or other
natural groupings. In the latter category, for example, there
may be a professional section (often called white-collar),
comprising clubs of teachers, doctors, or lawyers. A few members,
especially the deeply concealed communists, do not belong
to any club but are considered as <i>members-at-large</i>, subject
to control only from headquarters.</p>

<p>Determining which club a member should join is simple:
where can he do the most good for the Party? If he is employed
in the aluminum industry, for instance, he would
probably be instructed to join an aluminum club (made up of
members employed in the aluminum industry). If he is a
union officer, he might join a shop or industrial club. Or,
again, if his membership should be carefully concealed, he
would be a member-at-large. The organizational structure is
always in a state of flux, members being frequently shifted
from club to club, while headquarters organizes and reorganizes
sections and clubs, tearing down one, establishing another,
always hoping to gain greater efficiency.</p>

<p>Each club is required to have a chairman, a financial secretary,
and an educational director. A well-run club has many
more officers: literature director, press chairman, dues secretary,
membership chairman, and so on. The same is true of
county, city, and section groups; the communists have plenty
of officers. Moreover, a definite chain of command is always in
effect. Everybody knows his relative position: who are his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Party “inferior” and Party “boss.” Instructions are quickly
carried out, and in the event of an emergency a commanding
officer is always available.</p>

<p>Communist clubs are often named after famous American
historical figures such as Tom Paine, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham
Lincoln, Walt Whitman. Other clubs bear the names of
communist “heroes” such as John Reed.</p>

<h4>The Principle of “Democratic Centralism”</h4>

<p>This is a complicated structure, you might say. How does it
work? The point is: <i>it does work</i>, efficiently, effectively, and
all too often to the detriment of this nation. The whole Party
organization, regardless of its structural shape, is based on
strict discipline, a rigid hierarchy, and a unified structure.</p>

<p>The cement that holds it together is a principle called <i>democratic
centralism</i>. That sounds like a contradiction in terms; it
is. But communists like fancy words to fool their opponents
and, perhaps, to satisfy themselves. Democratic centralism is
the basic principle of communist organizational structure—a
term meaning, in actual practice, simple, naked, and unadulterated
dictatorship.</p>

<p>According to communists, Party members have a right to
participate in formulating policy and electing officers. That is,
to them, democracy in action.</p>

<p>An issue has arisen. The city is planning to close a play-ground.
What stand will the Party take? All members are encouraged
to express opinions. There may be different points of
view.</p>

<p>Then a decision is made—the communists say by an “election,”
but actually it is by the leader clique. The city’s action
will be opposed. From that moment, “centralism” takes over
and “democratic” falls away. All members, regardless of their
previous opinions, are required to support the Party’s stand.
No minority can exist.</p>

<p>Democratic centralism, communist leaders claim, combines
the “strictest discipline with the widest initiative and independent
activity of the Party membership.” It is “democratic”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
because of the preliminary “free discussion of issues” and
“right of election”; it is “centralism” because once a decision
is made, the discipline of the Party enforces the decision. This
is the ideal type of organizational structure, say the communists.</p>

<p>The tyranny and dictatorship that are part and parcel of the
Communist Party are laid down by the rule: all lower Party
organizations are subordinated to the higher bodies, and the
highest of all are the Congresses of the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union, which are run by the Kremlin.</p>

<p>A practical demonstration of democratic centralism at work
recently occurred in New York City. As we have mentioned,
a campaign was launched to circulate a petition to put Elizabeth
Gurley Flynn, a member of the National Committee, on
the ballot as candidate for the New York City Council. Although
the 1957 National Convention of the Party emphasized
that Party members could dissent from official Party policy,
William Weinstone, another member of the National Committee,
issued the order that “Those members who may not
agree with this campaign should nevertheless understand that
it is their duty to participate in signature getting.”</p>

<p>We in the FBI, through confidential sources of information,
know what goes on in hundreds of these meetings. We know
who the speakers are, what they say (and don’t say), what
decisions are made. These “free discussions” would be amusing
but for the deadly malady they highlight: a ruthless
thought control.</p>

<p>Communist members learn what to think, how to vote, what
to say by a process of “automatic osmosis”—the seeping of
predigested thoughts along the Party line into all subordinate
minds, disciplined to accept. The members become ideological
sleepwalkers, drugged into complete obedience by an unconscious
discipline.</p>

<p>Sometimes, absurd as it may seem, secret ballots are used.
Members go through all the motions of argument, taking a
vote, nominating and electing officers. They become excited,
waving their arms, pounding desks, shaking their fists. You
would think there was open opposition. But that is merely part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
of the show. Communist thought control, operating through
Party ranks, is a terrifying spectacle, freezing into fixed rigidity
the mental processes of thousands.</p>

<p>Seen in its true light, democratic centralism is a deceptive
cloak dropped over a ruthless dictatorship.</p>

<p>Sometimes a member, somehow or other, does not fathom
the Party line. He says something out of step. He is simply
“ill-informed” and needs more “education.” A Party school or
a conference will probably bring him back to his “right
senses.”</p>

<p>Occasionally a stubborn member will persist in criticism.
That takes courage. He is made of metal the communist
thought-control machine has not yet melted. He carries the
fight to higher Party bodies. But he can’t win and out he goes.</p>

<p>In one instance a member was accused of falling down on
the job. The section organizer recommended that he be removed
from both his Party office and the county executive
committee.</p>

<p>“He’s irresponsible,” stormed one old-time comrade, “and
in the Soviet Union irresponsibles are not voted out of office—they
are shot!”</p>

<p>That’s democratic centralism, the organizational principle
that has welded the Communist Party, USA, into a terrible
instrument poised and eager to destroy this country if given
the opportunity.</p>

<i>This Is the Party!</i></h3>

</div>

<p>What about life in the Party, how members live, who they
are, how they earn their money, what they do with their time,
and how they get their orders? The following are accounts of
day-to-day activities of Party life.</p>

<p>Eleanor is washing the dishes. Her husband, Henry, has just
gone to work. The two children are scurrying around the
house, ready to leave for school.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is a knock on the door. It is Ruth, who lives
across the street. Ruth is chairman of the East Side Communist
Club. Her husband, Robert, is state secretary of the Communist
Party and a full-time paid functionary.</p>

<p>“Starting the day out just right,” smiles Ruth. “The kitchen
is all cleaned up. You can come and help us.”</p>

<p>Ruth outlines her plans. The state office needs some typing
done this morning. Eleanor was a stenographer before she
married and often helps on a part-time basis at headquarters.
She is a trusted member. But that is not all. In the afternoon
Eleanor is to make “some calls”; that is, visit some comrades.
She must pass out word that the next meeting of the county
executive committee will be held on Friday evening. This message
cannot be given over the telephone. Then tonight will be
the regular meeting of the East Side Club. Eleanor probably
won’t get home in time to fix supper. If she doesn’t, Henry and
the kids can make some cold meat sandwiches. Besides, Henry
is scheduled to meet with the state education secretary tonight
and he won’t have time to eat supper anyway.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>Life in the Party! For good members nothing is left for life
outside the Party. The housewife is doing typing, running
errands, Mimeographing, arranging meetings, collecting dues;
her husband, even while working at the grocery store, in the
shoe factory, or at the service station, is thinking of his Party
assignment that night, distributing literature, soliciting money,
serving as a courier. The Party is the most important force in
their lives.</p>

<p>If anybody joins the Communist Party expecting to lead an
easy life, perhaps read Marx and Engels, buy some literature,
and not exert much effort, he is completely misguided. Party
work is hard, tough work, and the Party is a ruthless task-master.
The member is always on the run, doing this and
doing that. He has no spare time, energy, or money for himself.
His whole life becomes dominated. The Party is his
school, source of friends, and recreation, his substitute for
God. Communism wants the <i>total</i> man, hence it is <i>total</i>itarian.
That is part of its indoctrination policy: by concentrating
everything on the Party, all other interests are squeezed out.</p>

<p>Day and night the Party structure is buzzing with action:
fund drives, registration of members, collection of dues, sale
of literature. Leaflets must be passed out on Olive Street, a
picket line formed at city hall, a meeting attended. Workers,
not playboys, are wanted; or as one Party spokesman expressed
it, we must rid ourselves of the member who “makes noises
like an eager beaver but accomplishes little.” A major characteristic
of the Communist Party is perpetual motion.</p>

<p>The man who keeps this subversive beehive of activity going
is the paid Party functionary. He is the key to the whole
apparatus. Working on national, state, and local levels, he
pumps in energy, gives orders, coaxes, cajoles, threatens,
smiles, scowls, pleads, anything to keep the Party bustling.</p>

<p>Most communist functionaries are old-timers with ten, fifteen,
or twenty years of service. Some have been trained
abroad, possibly in the Lenin School in Moscow. They are
transferred at frequent intervals, depending on the needs of
the Party. One may serve as an organizer in California, as a
section secretary in Rhode Island, or as a fund-raiser in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
Florida. Their full-time job is to advance the communist
cause. The Party employs women functionaries, especially on
the lower levels. During World War II, when many male
comrades were drafted, a number of Party offices were run
by women.</p>

<p>Salaries vary, depending on the size and location of assignment,
but they average fifty to seventy dollars weekly. As a
general rule, officials are paid by the local organization, although
the national office, in case of a deficit, may step in with
cash. Some functionaries operate on an expense account, especially
if they travel.</p>

<p>The communist official will probably live in a modest neighborhood.
His wife will patronize the corner grocery store, his
children attend the local school. If a shoe store or a butcher
shop is operated by a Party member, the official will probably
get a discount on his purchases.</p>

<p>Most Party officials drive cars, usually older models. They
are generally out late at night attending meetings. A car is
essential for transportation and carrying literature. Except for
special affairs, communist activity is slight early in the morning.
The organizer, coming in around midnight or one o’clock,
will sleep late. But that doesn’t mean all day. One Southern
official was severely censured for sleeping too late; to solve the
problem the Party bought him an electric alarm clock.</p>

<p>Functionaries eat away from home a great deal. They generally
are well versed on “cozy” places where they can talk with
a minimum of observation. Much Party business is conducted
at luncheon appointments. Their wives are also engaged in
Party work, and often both are away from home night after
night. “Home,” to the communist organizer, is more a place to
sleep than to enjoy restful relaxation.</p>

<p>If a Party convention is to be held, and many out-of-town
delegates are coming in, the organizer may turn his apartment
into a temporary hotel. He will pull out all the spare cots,
beds, and blankets and “put up” a half-dozen visitors.</p>

<p>The paid official’s job is to keep the Party going, to see that
everybody has something to do, that meetings are scheduled,
that money is collected, that the Party’s program is carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
out. He may start his day around ten-thirty or eleven o’clock
with a “staff” conference at headquarters. There he will discuss
the day’s agenda with other officials, give or receive
orders, and get squared away for the day’s work.</p>

<p>The organizer must be a fairly intelligent man with an
ability to get along with people. He is always asking for
something: Can you deliver papers, how about attending this
class, making a speech? He must know how to overcome fears,
suspicions, and laziness, and encourage members to work. He
may, for example, approach a member for a donation: “We
need five hundred dollars. Sell your car and donate the
money.” Communists come up with all kinds of schemes. The
organizer must go out and “sell” the idea.</p>

<p>He also spends a great deal of time smoothing out personal
problems. In one case a communist “love triangle” erupted. A
young Party member, even though married, decided that she
loved another member’s husband. The man’s wife, however,
was determined to fight. The problem reached such bitterness
that the trio’s Party work began to suffer. There was little hope
of solving it by themselves. So the state chairman stepped in.</p>

<p>He talked to them personally. They poured out their inner
feelings. The young woman and her “lover” requested Party
approval for a divorce. A few days later the wife, with fire in
her eyes, told the state chairman she wanted three months’
leave of absence from the Party to regain the love of her husband.
A regular free-for-all was brewing. The Party, however,
exerted pressure and the situation was settled. No divorce was
approved. The organizer must be ready at any hour to settle
everything, from a hair-pulling contest to the distribution of
an estate.</p>

<p>For most members the Party is their whole life. If any problems
arise, changing jobs, adopting a child, lawsuits, etc., they
solve them with the Party’s advice. If a member has a case
of ulcers, the organizer will recommend a “Party doctor”; if
somebody is threatening suit, he will suggest a “Party lawyer”;
if one has lost his job, he might know somebody in the Party,
perhaps the owner of a store, a union-shop steward, or an
industrial executive, who will help out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>The Party, in many respects, is a vast paternalistic system.
Not that it is humanitarian, full of mercy, or interested in the
members’ welfare. Nothing like that. The Party’s interests
come first. If a member is sick, tied up with a lawsuit, or unemployed,
his Party work will suffer. Each member should be
in top working shape at all times. The Party functionary’s job
is to seek out and solve these problems. He is an administrator,
expediter, and nursemaid.</p>

<p>Also, any activity that might injure the Party must be prevented.
The discipline of the Party, exercised through the
functionary, extends to the most intimate details of personal
life. Here are a few actual cases:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">A member in Ohio desired to adopt a child whose parents were
members of the Catholic Church, and the member had taken
steps to join the Church. The state chairman was furious and
said no. Finally the member asserted his independence and
left the Party.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">Another member, in the Party’s eyes, manifested “bourgeois”
tendencies. He spent too much time working on his house! He
was removed from his Party position.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">One member in the state of Washington went to Alaska, without
permission, to secure a job. He was suspended on the
ground that he would attract the FBI’s attention in Alaska.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">A member in New York City, age thirty-five, was dropped from
the rolls. Why? In the Party’s eyes he was too much dominated
by his mother.</p>

</div>

<p>Sometimes the functionary will order the member to take an
affirmative step:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">A strawberry farmer was visited in Everett, Washington, by a
Party fund-raiser who demanded one hundred dollars, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
the farmer did not have. The farmer was ordered to mortgage
his house. He refused and was expelled for failure to abide by
Communist Party discipline.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">In Philadelphia the district organizer called at the residence
of a couple with a long record of devoted Party activity. The
organizer announced that the wife was being dropped from the
Party because she was anticommunist. When pressed for an
explanation, the organizer stated he had concluded that the
wife had written critical letters regarding the Party leaders,
which she vigorously denied. The organizer then advanced a
further reason. A news account had appeared in the papers
recounting that her brother, an Air Force Reservist, had been
killed in a plane crash and she had failed to advise the Party
that he had been called to active duty. The wife then made
the futile complaint that, since she was being dropped from
the Party and not expelled, she had no way to appeal the
decision or to defend herself. Then the organizer told the husband
that he had to either leave his wife and children or be
dropped from the Party. When he elected to remain with his
wife, he was ousted from the Party, as was a former Party
organizer who continued to associate with the wife.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">A promising young communist was attending a Communist
Party training school in New York. He was called out of class
and advised that the Party had decided that he was to marry
a young lady who had just arrived from Hungary on a student
visa. The Party felt the girl was promising Party material. The
communist went to City Hall accompanied by a fellow student,
the bride-to-be, and her sister. The ceremony was performed,
which enabled the girl to stay in the United States since she
was now married to an American citizen. The marriage was in
form only, and three years later the girl secured a divorce. In
the meantime the young communist was sent to West Virginia
as a functionary and started living with another girl. She also
had a citizenship problem. This was met when the two
were called to New York for a meeting. In passing through
Elkton, Maryland, they secured a marriage license and returned
after the New York meeting for the ceremony. The girl<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
then went on to Chicago. When the communist finally met the
lady of his choice, he went to a communist lawyer who arranged
for an annulment of the second marriage on the ground
that a prenuptial agreement to join the church had been
violated.</p>

</div>

<p>The Party functionary can order members to resign from
one job and accept another, to move from one town to another,
to stop seeing their families and friends, to lie, cheat, or
steal.</p>

<p>Then there is the problem of money. The functionary is always
prodding. First, members must pay dues. They are collected
monthly from each member and give the Party a substantial
source of revenue. Payments of dues are based on
regular schedules, depending on a member’s income. Here is
a sample schedule:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th><i>Income Per Week</i></th>
    <th><i>Dues Per Month</i></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Housewives</td>
    <td class="tdr">.50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Students</td>
    <td class="tdr">.50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unemployed</td>
    <td class="tdr">.50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To $80</td>
    <td class="tdr">$1.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>To $110</td>
    <td class="tdr">$2.50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Over $110</td>
    <td class="tdr">$5.00</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Dues also serve another purpose: to control the member.
The Party official can keep track of him, see if his interest is
waning (if he doesn’t want to pay), and also, if possible,
determine how much money he actually has (which the Party
can later extract). If he falls behind in payments, the financial
secretary will be right after him.</p>

<p>Another related obligation is to donate money (besides paying
dues). Every member <i>must</i> pay, and pay until it hurts.
The Party conducts an annual fund drive, involving the whole
membership. Goals are set for clubs, sections, regions, and on
a national basis. A big celebration, perhaps a dance or a dinner,
marks the “kick-off,” and a definite conclusion date is
established. During this period, say September 1 to October<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
15, a white heat of intensity is reached. The theme: “Money,
money, money.” No member, regardless of excuse, is spared.
If the amount isn’t reached, the campaign is extended.</p>

<p>How much should a member give? Usually a week’s wages
is the accepted minimum. If a comrade has extra sources of
income, the amount will be higher.</p>

<p>The Party raises money, lots of it. In one fund drive alone,
for example, national headquarters announced a collection of
over 165,000 dollars. And the campaign was still not complete.
The nickels and dimes (although communists say they like
“folding money” best) soon add up. With the effectiveness of
a vacuum cleaner, the Party pulls money from everywhere.</p>

<p>Laggards, renegers, and backsliders are pushed hard.
“That’s not enough. You’re a piker,” the Party organizer will
scoff. Sections and clubs vie for “collection honors.” The first
state or district to reach its quota is enthusiastically hailed.</p>

<p>But that is not the end of “donations.” Time after time there
are assessments or special fund drives. They come like snowflakes
in a winter storm. Party leaders have been arrested, they
need help! (Defense Fund). The <i>Daily Worker</i> needs money—urgently!
(Press Fund). The Party must have 100,000 dollars
in thirty days! (Emergency Fund). An “emergency” is always
stalking the Communist Party. The best way to solve it is
money. The only thing better is more money. The cost to
members: at least a day’s pay for each special fund.</p>

<p>Fund drives do not exhaust the financial wizardry of the
communists. Money is obtained in still other ways, such as
Hallowe’en parties, dances, waffle parties, going-away affairs,
testimonial dinners, anniversaries (such as of the October
Revolution in Russia or the birthday of Lenin). In most instances
tickets are sold and, in addition, a collection may be
taken up. Everything you have belongs to the Party. That’s
the philosophy.</p>

<p>One top leader explained how to obtain contributions. Visit
the prospective victim. Take along an out-of-town comrade
(he’s the high-pressure expert) and a local member. The latter
should have plenty of money with him. The prospective victim
might say, “Yes, I’d like to contribute, but I haven’t any money<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
now”—the easy way out. If so, the local comrade would interrupt
and say, “Fine, I’ll lend you the money. Would a hundred
dollars be enough?” This squeeze always works, the
leader said. Blank checks are also carried.</p>

<p>To show how far money-raising can go, one member
dreamed up the idea that bodies of deceased comrades should
be sold for medical experimentation. The Party would gain
doubly: first it demanded the fee for the cadaver and then the
money ordinarily spent for the burial. Another member suggested
that gifts no longer be given at “stork” showers for
expectant mothers. This money should be donated to the
Party.</p>

<p>Then there are extra revenue sources. At the end of World
War II, Party officials requested comrades returning from
military service to donate part of their bonus money. In many
instances they set the actual amount. If the member didn’t
comply, he might be disciplined.</p>

<p>Estates are also juicy morsels. If members, or maybe sympathizers,
have any extra money, the Party urges that wills be
executed naming the Party or certain functionaries as beneficiaries.
Large sums are thus often gained.</p>

<p>Some years ago a former Episcopal bishop died in Ohio.
Years before, during an illness, he had started reading Marx
and other communist books. Then he turned author and wrote
a book entitled <i>Communism and Christianism</i>, wherein he
expressed doubt that Christ had ever lived, and asserted that
he had “found Christ via Karl Marx.” The bishop was given a
trial by his church and deposed. Following his death, his will
provided that the residue of his estate, valued at between
300,000 and 400,000 dollars, was to go to a corporation whose
trustees were to devote all or any part of it to the cause of
communism as “propagated by Karl Marx.”</p>

<p>Another communist sympathizer in Oregon a few years ago
received more than 100,000 dollars upon the death of a son.
A communist friend persuaded the sympathizer to bequeath
a part of his estate to two West Coast communists.</p>

<p>A Party member died in Massachusetts in 1953, leaving a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
14,000-dollar bank account and real estate to the Party, naming
three Party officials as executors of his will.</p>

<p>Over the years the Party has been blessed by angels and
foundations whose money was made through the American
free enterprise system and is then used in an attempt to destroy
the system that made wealth and affluence possible.</p>

<p>In years past, each member was given a membership card
or book (which was numbered) on which he could paste his
“dues stamps,” showing that he was current on this obligation.
But today, for security reasons, this practice is no longer followed.
Membership records, if kept, are carefully concealed,
and only a trusted few know their whereabouts. Sometimes
elaborate code, color, and tab combinations are used on such
records to indicate the name, occupation, sex, length of Party
service, etc., of the members.</p>

<p>To join the Communist Party does not automatically mean
life tenure. Memberships must be renewed every year or, in
communist language, members are “reregistered.” This represents
another means of control. If a member is delinquent in
dues or donations, he’ll have to pay a penalty, perhaps contribute
ten dollars, or be disciplined. These annual registration
drives are important events in Party life. Each member is personally
contacted. Clubs and sections compete for speed and
percentage of successful registration. The drives usually start
in October and often extend well past the December 31 deadline.</p>

<p>A member moves. His district organization will send details
concerning him to his new area: name, Party history, whether
dues are paid, along with any other remarks. A member may
be given half of a dollar bill and the other half forwarded to
the new district. When the member arrives, the halves are
matched. Identity is thus established.</p>

<p>So it goes, a constant round of rushing, driving, pushing,
paying, never time to stop. The member is regimented from
life to death. His chief obligation: to follow instructions
eagerly, energetically, obediently. He is a mere wisp of living
matter, born, as a <i>Daily Worker</i> birth announcement proclaimed,
“for swelling our ranks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>This complete absorption in the Party creates an exhilaration
that warps judgment. One comrade became so wrought
up over the supposed superiority of communist culture that
he cited statistics that the Soviet soldier in World War II was
an inch taller and had a chest one and a half inches larger
than his Czarist counterpart!</p>

<p>Such fervor sounds laughable, but it is symptomatic of paranoiac
behavior. To an individual like this, any communist
achievement surpasses anything American. This bigoted communist
fanaticism drives members to mortgage their homes,
spend years in underground shelters, and betray their native
land.</p>

<p>Even in death a member may become a pawn to enhance
the Party. The passing of a prominent comrade invariably is
the occasion for a “state funeral.” The departed member is
now a valuable showpiece and his passing is exploited to the
fullest extent. On such occasions the deceased lies in state on
the day of the funeral, with “mourners” passing the bier. A
large, blown-up photograph of the deceased, draped in black,
hangs at the rear of the stage. An honor guard of from two
to four comrades stands at attention wearing red armbands.</p>

<p>There is seldom a religious quality to the music, eulogies, or
the “mourners’” conduct. At the “state funeral” of Mother Ella
Reeve Bloor in 1951 the “mourners” talked, laughed, and
smoked.</p>

<p>The eulogies are numerous and recount the contributions
made by the deceased to the Communist Party, to the advancement
of socialism, and state how the Party can learn
from the life of the departed. At Mother Bloor’s funeral in
New York City, for example, Pettis Perry, a member of the
National Committee, said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">This is not farewell to you, Mother Bloor. We pledge to follow
in your footsteps.... We will build your Party and our Party
and some day we will have a nation and a society built on
the brotherhood of man....</p>

</div>

<p>At the funeral of Peter V. Cacchione, an elected member of
the New York City Council, nineteen speakers delivered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
eulogies. Gilbert Green, then chairman of the Party in Illinois,
speaking for the National Committee, observed that the deceased
fell in the struggle as “a soldier in the cause of human
freedom,” and vowed that the remaining comrades would take
“the banner from his hands.”</p>

<p>After such services a cortege of automobiles laden with
mourners journeys from the funeral hall to the cemetery. As
Mother Bloor was lowered into her grave at Harleigh
Cemetery in Camden, New Jersey, Walter Lowenfels, then
the Philadelphia correspondent of the <i>Daily Worker</i>, read
Walt Whitman’s poem, “The Mystic Trumpeter.”</p>

<p>At the Cacchione interment Henry Winston, a member of
the National Committee, delivered these parting words, “We
are confident, as you were, dear Pete, in ultimate victory....
We will carry out your heritage.”</p>

<p>Through it all runs the hope, not of life everlasting, but of
communism everlasting—if the members can be stirred up to
work harder.</p>

<i>Making Communist Man</i></h3>

</div>

<p>In the last chapter we examined life in the Party—the constant
hustle, collecting of dues, registration of members, holding
of conferences, issuing of instructions.</p>

<p>These activities, however, have a meaning more sinister
than just keeping the Party going, a meaning that we over-look
at our peril. It is this: the Party is a vast workshop where
the member is polished and shined, his impurities melted out,
his loyalty to communism strengthened. He is made into
<i>communist man</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>The revolution requires, as Lenin taught, that the fanatical
believer be a man who, if so instructed, will give his life to the
cause. He’s the paid functionary we met in the last chapter,
the agitator and propaganda agent we’ll see in future pages.
Without him communism would be just another “ism.”</p>

<p>This type of man doesn’t just grow; he must be created. To
understand fully how this happens, we must now briefly
examine the Party’s educational, press, literature, and cultural
programs, its chief weapons of indoctrination.</p>

<p>Suppose one joined the Party. How would these techniques
of regimentation affect the new member? We can best consider
this question under several headings.</p>

<h4>Back to School</h4>

<p>One of the first things a new member does is to go to a
school. He’ll receive his instructions soon after joining, probably
from his club chairman. And as long as he stays in the
Party, he’ll continue to go to school. Even the grizzled veterans
go. There’s a diabolical reason behind this, which we’ll soon
see.</p>

<p>Most people don’t think of the Communist Party as an
educational institution. Yet year after year the Party operates
a school system of vast proportions: theory schools; orientation
schools; specialized schools in current events, history,
economics, social problems; schools in Party techniques: how
to collect dues, recruit new members, serve as a club chairman,
be a better public speaker; and, of course, schools on
revolutionary tactics and procedure. In recent years the Party
has been extremely subtle in teaching its doctrines of revolution,
always remembering federal laws such as the Smith Act,
which prohibits advocating the overthrow of the United States
government by force and violence.</p>

<p>Education, in the communist scheme, means indoctrination,
imbuing the member with qualities desired by the Party. The
pertinent question always is: How can the member be trained
to serve the Party better?</p>

<p>Classes are held on all levels—local, state, regional, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
national, varying in length from an hour to several weeks. For
security reasons members meet in an isolated building, a
home, or even in an automobile or a public park. The teacher
is usually a paid functionary or someone from the county or
state educational commission. Class consists of an extended
lecture, perhaps for an hour or so, followed by discussion. As
a general rule, no note-taking is allowed. The class over, each
student leaves, careful not to attract attention.</p>

<p>After the beginning, or orientation, school (where members
are soaked with Aesopian double talk) is over, the member is
ready for a more advanced class. Never is he told at the outset
that he is being changed into a Bolshevik, that his loyalty is
being shifted to Soviet Russia, and that the American government
must be overthrown. That would scare him away. The
Party’s indoctrination process is slow and gradual. The member
himself seldom realizes that bit by bit his precommunist
training is being extracted and replaced by Party ideology.</p>

<p>Most important, he is grounded in love of the Party. This is
a cardinal duty of the communist teacher.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... the cause of Communism is the greatest and most arduous
cause in the history of mankind.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>To sacrifice one’s personal interests and even one’s life without
the slightest hesitation and even with a feeling of happiness,
for the cause of the Party ... is the highest manifestation
of Communist ethics.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>The true Communist ... must feel that the Party does not
owe him a thing; it is he who owes everything ... to the Party.</p>

</div>

<p>Party schools make extensive use of study outlines and lesson
aids supplied by national, state, and local educational
commissions. They are written in a simple style and slanted to
the average reader. Many contain suggested readings, illustrative
examples, and review questions. Usually Mimeographed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
they deal with all phases of the Party’s program.
Sample titles are “Lenin and Our Party,” “World Significance
of the Events in China,” “New Members Session and Introduction
in the Communist Party,” and “Farmers in the Coalition.”</p>

<p>Amazing attention is shown to detail. In advanced classes
members will have homework and examinations. As part of
the instruction, classes often are given practical “field work.”
Students in one Midwestern school were dismissed, divided
into teams, and sent to industrial plants to distribute Party
literature. That evening they reassembled to discuss their experiences
and receive ideas on how better to do the job.</p>

<p>The longer one stays in the Party, the more specialized are
the classes he attends. The goal, of course, is to be selected to
attend a national leadership school. This means going to New
York City or a Party camp and staying several weeks. Students
probably will not know the true names of their fellow
students; they’ll remember them as Sam (an alias), the man
with the crooked arm, the redheaded girl who talked so much,
the old man with the green shirt. That’s part of the Party’s
security program.</p>

<p>The communist educational system is extremely practical:
training members to do what the Party needs. Perhaps more
Mimeograph operators are needed; then there’ll be a Mimeograph
school. Maybe more dues secretaries are needed; then
there’ll be a dues secretaries’ school. All the time, through
training, the member is being pulled more closely under Party
discipline.</p>

<h4>Home Study</h4>

<p>Another indoctrination technique is self- or home study.
Going to school is important, but at best it can be for only an
hour a day or several weeks a year. More study is needed to
bind the member to the Party.</p>

<p>One Party directive puts it this way:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Every Communist must read and study the classics of our
literature, past and present. Everyone must rigorously enforce
the slogan, “One night a week for Marxist study.”</p>

</div>

<p>Communists may be busy or deeply involved in other Party
work. But they must also carry on self-study or, as the communists
call it, <i>ideological self-cultivation</i> or <i>raising the ideological
level of the member</i>. This means daily readings in the communist
bible—the works of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. (Following
Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin, the late dictator’s
works were appreciably de-emphasized in Party study programs.)
This is not something optional; it is an absolute requirement.
To study the communist “masters,” says the Party,
is to be made “perfect” as they were “perfect”—and incidentally
to make members work harder selling papers, collecting
dues, and handing out leaflets.</p>

<p>In the final analysis this communist education, like all
phases of the Party’s program, is geared to <i>revolutionary
action</i>. “It is for the Party and for the victory of the revolution
that we study.” The Party isn’t training its members just
for fun. Each one must be steeled, hardened, and purified of
his capitalist “scum,” “filth,” and “dirt.” The new member was
born and reared under capitalism and, in communist eyes,
therefore he is infected with “selfishness,” “intrigue,” “class
attitudes.” “Is it anything strange,” one communist writer
asks, “that there are muddy stains on a person who crawls
out of the mud...?”</p>

<p>These stains must be washed off. It’s a lifetime job. Non-Party
or “capitalist” attitudes keep cropping out. Some have
been inherited, others newly acquired from capitalist contamination.
That’s why even old-time members keep attending
school. It’s like cleaning a skillet that tarnishes. Constant
scrubbing (more indoctrination) is needed to make and keep
the member ideologically pure.</p>

<p>Communist education is constantly seeking to destroy the
“remnants of bourgeois ideology,” the undigested lumps of
independence not yet crushed by communist thought control.
That is the gnawing fear of all communist regimes: that an
undigested lump will be missed, that somewhere lying undetected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
is a member who has not been completely indoctrinated.
This individual is a potential enemy who may someday
rise against his masters.</p>

<p>The Party has a term, <i>political maturity</i>, to signify the member
who has been so indoctrinated that, as a matter of sixth
sense, he will always know the Party line.</p>

<h4>Party Literature</h4>

<p>The Party’s literature program (comprising newspapers,
magazines, pamphlets, and books) is a companion to Party
schools and self-study in helping to create communist man.</p>

<p>These publications, regardless of their form, tell but one
story, the Party’s story. The member must believe no other. For
this purpose the Party is operating a multihundred-thousand-dollar
propaganda machine.</p>

<p>Inside the Party the refrain is constantly heard: Buy our
literature. “Got a nickel, mister? Try this pamphlet.” “You
don’t want to miss our paper.” “Here, subscribe to <i>Political
Affairs</i>” (the Party’s monthly theoretical magazine). The pressure
is terrific. Party-operated bookstores and newspaper
carrier routes distribute a steady stream of Party literature,
as do the clubs themselves.</p>

<p>“We probably circulate more literature per member of our
organization by ten times,” one former Party leader said,
“than any other organization in existence.”</p>

<p>The Party’s chief newspaper is the <i>Daily Worker</i> (and its
week-end edition, <i>The Worker</i>), published in New York City.
On the West Coast it’s the <i>People’s World</i> (a weekly published
in San Francisco).</p>

<p>Don’t think of the <i>Daily Worker</i> in terms of your own daily
newspaper. It is strictly a propaganda organ. A tabloid with
bold, black headlines, its “news” stories, editorials, book reviews,
even its sports columns, are slanted to promote the
Party’s views.</p>

<p>For example, <i>Daily Worker</i> sports writer Lester Rodney, in
his column “On the Scoreboard,” praises “the phenomenal and
growing successes of the Soviet Union in the world of sports.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
He says, “... the answer is socialism. If Russians were just so
all-fired hot as Russians, where were all their champion teams
and athletes under the Czar?”</p>

<p>In obvious glee Rodney writes: “So fellow sports lovers, this
socialism deserves a little open-minded study, at least, that’s
clear. (There’s a fine school over on Sixth Ave. and 16th St.
where you can study it if you’re lucky enough to be a New
Yorker.)” The Jefferson School of Social Science, a front
school, was then located at this address.</p>

<p>And Rodney couldn’t miss the chance for another propaganda
plug:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Just one more thing and really the most important for today
with all the “Soviet menace” hogwash. No matter what you
may or may not think of their socialism, it is self-evident that
a nation which loves to play and is turning out fine athletes
in increasing numbers and building more and more sports
fields is a nation which is thinking about peace and not war.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Daily Worker</i> serves as a unifier of policy, an organizer
of action, and a Party builder. It is a public document. Hence,
don’t expect to find there Party secrets, such as the identities
of underground officials or decisions of confidential meetings.
However, for those who understand its double talk it provides
a quick means to communicate the Party line. Moreover, it
does not let the membership forget the identity of the Party’s
enemies and sometimes its friends. Like a vast searchlight, it
gives direction to members, wherever they may be.</p>

<p>Day after day the <i>Daily Worker</i> drills a central theme into
its readers: that life in the United States is terrible; that only
in communist countries, especially in the Soviet Union, is
life worth living at all.</p>

<p>The day’s news is scanned for some incident to distort and
use to browbeat the United States. Any action of the American
government is always, somehow or other, part of a conspiracy
to engulf the world in World War III. One rat in a tenement
house becomes an army of rats devouring thousands of people.
Pick out every weakness, real or imaginary. Stir up dissension.
Try to weaken morale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>After Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin, the <i>Daily Worker</i>
carried some criticism of Soviet Russia, for the most part pertaining
to anti-Semitism and illegal arrests. Certain aspects of
Russia’s intervention in Hungary were also criticized. Highly
novel for the <i>Daily Worker</i>, this criticism apparently reflected
the personal views of John Gates, the editor. Gates, of all the
top Party leaders, appeared to have been most affected by
Khrushchev’s revelations. He was severely attacked, however,
by other Party officials, including William Z. Foster, and his
resignation was demanded. Nevertheless, despite this limited
criticism, the <i>Daily Worker</i> remained loyal to the over-all
aims of Soviet Russia and continues to belittle, mock, and
criticize American life.</p>

<p>This loyalty to things Russian has caused the <i>Daily Worker</i>
to perform some interesting gymnastics. A good example was
the famous “Doctors’ Plot,” early in 1953, just before Stalin’s
death. Moscow reported the arrest of nine doctors charged
with plotting to kill high-ranking Soviet officials. “Moscow
Nips Plot to Kill Army Chiefs,” headlined <i>The Worker</i>
(January 18, 1953), obviously happy. Then the doctors were
suddenly released. Back-flipped <i>The Worker</i> with the greatest
of ease: “The Case of the Soviet Doctors, How a Socialist
State Protects Its Citizens” (April 12, 1953).</p>

<p>In March, 1953, <i>The Worker</i> reported Stalin’s death.
“<span class="smcap">Stalin</span>: Man of Peace,” “The Cobbler’s Son Who Built a New
World,” “‘His Name and His Work Will Endure Through the
Ages,’” “Stalin—Architect of a Working People’s World.” In
1956 the headlines shifted: “Lenin’s Principles Abandoned by
Stalin,” “Minorities Were Exiled and Mistreated,” “Says
Stalin Unleashed Mass Terror 1936-1937.” One writer headed
his column: “Stalin Wasn’t God—And We Weren’t Angels.”</p>

<p>Communists regard themselves as “apostles” of a new order
living in “enemy-controlled” territory. Communists claim that
the <i>Daily Worker</i> cuts through the “capitalist press” and its
smog of “lies,” “distortions,” and “fakes,” bringing “truthful
information.” This is the highest principle of a “free press.”</p>

<p>The communist press, with its bigoted, perverted, single
point of view, is a disturbing reality. It seeks the definite,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
systematic, and mass indoctrination of the minds of men to
trust only the Party. Truth becomes what a group of men say
it is.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of how “freedom of the press” works for
the communists:</p>

<p>A Party leader hurried toward the building where a convention
was being held. Just outside the door he paused. An
individual was handing out leaflets urging the election of a
slate opposed by the Party.</p>

<p>“That guy ought to be thrown out,” the Party boss remarked
to a companion. “He’s nothing but a Trotskyite. He
shouldn’t be allowed around here.”</p>

<p>Some time later the same two men were again attending a
meeting. This time the <i>Daily Worker</i> was being sold outside.
The companion objected, saying this wasn’t a communist
meeting.</p>

<p>“Uh,” retorted the Party member. “This is a free country.
You can’t stop him from passing it out.”</p>

<p>No wonder communism can operate only in the glow of
book burnings. No opposite view can be tolerated. “Down
with non-party writers!” Lenin demanded.</p>

<p>As an example, after Browder’s “fall from power” in 1945,
many of his books were burned. Shifts in the Party line also
cause book burnings. One New England headquarters, caught
in a Party shift, destroyed three barrels of literature. What is
“true” today in the Party may not be “true” tomorrow.</p>

<p>Modern-day techniques of literature dissemination extend
the tyranny of communist indoctrination. The Party wants
mass readership. Always remember that the communists are
practical, everyday agitators. Why publish something at a
high price that few will buy? There are few fancy bindings,
engravings, or pictures. Communist publishing firms have exploited
the publication of pamphlet-form editions and paper-backed
volumes, anything to gain circulation and spread the
communist message.</p>

<p>Prices are now higher, but communist literature is today
being sold for five, ten, twenty, twenty-five, and thirty-five
cents. Even these prices are considered too high. “I do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
consider a five-cent pamphlet mass literature. We have to go
back to mass penny literature ...,” one Party leader commented.
Amazing circulations have been achieved. Editions
of Lenin’s <i>Imperialism</i> and <i>State and Revolution</i>, totaling
100,000 copies each and costing ten cents a copy, were issued.
Other pamphlets were printed in editions totaling 307,000;
275,000; 350,000; 440,000.</p>

<p>Everything possible has been done to make available in
English the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. A
twelve-volume series of Lenin’s <i>Selected Works</i>, over 6000
pages, sells for twenty-five dollars. Marx’s <i>The Civil War in
France</i> is offered for a dollar and fifty cents (cloth); paper-bound,
twenty-five cents. The most important writings of
Lenin are made available in the “Little Lenin Library” (for
Marx it’s the “Little Marx Library”), with prices ranging from
five to ninety cents. Many foreign communist writings are
also printed. During the period 1948-55, according to a report
of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, the writings of Lenin were more widely translated
than the Bible, with Stalin’s writings ranking third.
Mention should also be made of communist-shop leaflets,
neighborhood papers, and throwaways that are placed on
doorsteps, thrown into parked cars, or scattered in buildings.
Generally Mimeographed, they represent an easy, cheap, and
effective method of stirring up trouble.</p>

<p>The pressure is terrific—buy, buy, buy. Widely publicized
campaigns to sell the <i>Daily Worker</i> are regular features of
Party life. The more communist material a member reads, the
less time he has for reading “capitalist propaganda.”</p>

<h4>Cultural Indoctrination</h4>

<p>Even if a member faithfully went to school, studied at
home, and read Party literature, he would still have spare time
during which non-Party thoughts might seep in. That would
never do.</p>

<p>Every facet of the member’s life, even when he plays the
piano, sings, goes to a movie, sees a painting, or reads a book,
must be saturated with communism. Art doesn’t exist for art’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
sake. Art, as Lenin taught, is a weapon of the class struggle.
“Culture” becomes an indoctrinal spray seeking to control
every part of the member’s heart, mind, and soul.</p>

<p>The member is subjected to a barrage of Russian, satellite,
and native communist “cultural” propaganda. There are art
exhibits, folk dances, theater groups, nationality bazaars.
Many of these are carried on through front groups and hence
not labeled as communist. The <i>Daily Worker</i> advertises Soviet
movies, which are often shipped to Party units across the
country. Short stories, novels, and poetry come in steady
streams. Forums extol the virtue of Soviet life. Here, the
communists say, is the new “people’s culture,” bringing the
“real truth.”</p>

<p>The theme is always the same: Russia and communism
represent a new world of “hope,” “promise,” and “achievement,”
creating “communist man” in all his “remarkable
spiritual qualities.” The United States is a “weak,” “decadent,”
and “sick” country, dominated by vulgar tastes, thievery, and
debauched living. No wonder, according to the <i>Daily Worker</i>,
the Soviet soldier in World War II spent his time reading
Shakespeare and Tolstoy while the “uncultured” GI read
assorted inferior trash!</p>

<p>The member is urged to read Soviet literature and see the
“glorious” communist “hero” working his heart out for the
regime. This “hero”—usually just an ordinary, plain fellow
(like the member)—can repair a blast furnace in one day instead
of the usual six to eight weeks. Why? For the glory of
communism. Another “hero” is sad and disheartened. He has
bungled his factory job. He wasn’t doing his share. But a
strong arm is around his shoulders, the arm of an experienced
worker. He’ll show the worker “hero” how to break production
records, for communism—when in real life he might be headed
for a slave labor camp.</p>

<p>Day after day this propaganda is dinned into the member.</p>

<p>Children are included. The Party feels that the basic
responsibility of indoctrinating the child lies with the communist
parents. A member in Buffalo announced, for instance,
that a class for children, aged five to seven, would be held in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
the basement of her home. Ironically, it was called “Sunday
school” because it was held on Sunday. But, the member
added, this school was not to teach “the word of God or in
any way teach religion.” The instruction obviously would be
directed to the fundamentals of Marxism.</p>

<p>Books are published for children. One, <i>Our Lenin</i>, is a
story of Lenin’s life, translated and adapted “for American
children.” In this an American worker is quoted: “‘It [the
Soviet Union] will last forever, and we here will follow its
example.’” It’s a steady diet of propaganda.</p>

<p>Suppose the member wants to write, paint, or compose
music? He, too, must follow the Party line. His work must
promote communism.</p>

<p>Some of the writings are very crude, but they get across the
Party line. Here’s a poem that appeared in the <i>Daily Worker</i>
shortly after Stalin’s death, eulogizing the Soviet dictator:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">He was melted in the open hearth of feudal czarist oppression</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He was forged in the fire of revolution</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His chemistry was the chemistry of struggle</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And left him as pure as the hope of liberation of the working class</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He was alloyed with large masses of the Soviet peoples and heaping shovelfuls<br> of international brotherhood with just the right amount of love<br> for humanity to finally make—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A man of steel....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An artist wants to paint a flock of birds in a tree. That’s
silly, the Party says. There’s no communist message. Here’s
how his idea can be improved.</p>

<p>Make one bird a white dove and, presto, you’re right in line
with the communist “peace” offensive. Another improvement:
Put a mean-looking capitalist “warmonger” under the tree
taking aim at the peaceful dove.</p>

<p>Just the name of the picture often gives a communist twist.
A drawing of a sleeping child, cuddling her baby bear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
couldn’t be labeled “Slumber.” No propaganda there. “Too
Hungry to Stay Awake” would be better, to show how people
are starving in the United States. A young lady walking down
the street smiling and confident isn’t “Girl on a Stroll” but
“Battler for Peace.” The beauty and power of any work of art
must be measured by “the degree to which it is permeated
with the ideas of Communism.” This is the way, the communists
say, that the masses can be directed.</p>

<p>The Party, in the final analysis, has an interpretation for the
whole of human life. Nothing is untouched: science, psychology,
sex, love, care of children, literature, history, the
origin and end of life. Everything must be absorbed. Communism
is a unitary, all-embracing, and absolute system.</p>

<p>Not only the present but also the past must be controlled.
Communist writers have already reinterpreted American history,
claiming that the Party is today the true inheritor of the
traditions of 1776. They seek to associate themselves with such
men as Paine, Jefferson, and Lincoln, whom they identify as
“advanced fighters” for the ideals that the communists claim
they now represent. For example, the <i>Daily Worker</i> on Lincoln’s
Birthday in 1953 said, “Lincoln’s heritage is carried
forward mainly by the working class and its Marxist party.”</p>

<p>In literature they seek to pervert such writers as Walt
Whitman and Mark Twain, claiming, for instance, that Whitman’s
love of freedom is the story of their own aims. “... poet
and prophet of a people’s democracy” was the <i>Daily Worker’s</i>
salute.</p>

<p>The Party conducts an annual pilgrimage to Whitman’s
tomb in Harleigh Cemetery, Camden, New Jersey. Mother
Bloor, the “old mother” of communism, made a fetish of her
alleged friendship with Whitman.</p>

<p>Twain’s life, a <i>Worker</i> article asserted, was an inspiration to
fight against “imperialism and war.”</p>

<p>Carried to its logical conclusion, this attitude creates different
holidays, customs, and habits for the communists.
Christmas, for example, is exploited for propaganda purposes;
it is a time to send out cards for “peace,” to urge amnesty for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
communists in jail, to appeal for funds. It holds no religious
significance for Party members. A communist America would
celebrate the birth of Karl Marx rather than the birth of
Christendom.</p>

<p>This constant saturation with communism, through Party
education, literature, the press, and “culture,” has had its effect
in shaping communist man. A comrade writing in <i>Party Voice</i>,
organ of the New York State Communist Party, frankly admitted
what is happening:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">I have no doubt that there are comrades in our movement who
have not read a single American book outside of progressive
literature in many moons but who can discuss in detail the
latest Soviet book or periodical from China.
... we have many comrades who have been brought up on
Soviet culture and who are not familiar with the cultural life
of our own people.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">There are some comrades who never see an American film but
confine their movie-going to nothing but foreign films. There
are others who see only the decline and fall of American culture
but fail to see what is new and growing.</p>

</div>

<p>So far has the creation of communist man gone that, in some
instances, Party members are embarrassed to salute the American
flag. The <i>Party Voice</i> comrade tells how embarrassed he
felt as he hesitantly saluted the flag at a Memorial Day parade.
“At times I looked up and down the street and hoped, inwardly,
that none of my ‘left’ friends were looking at me.” So
great is the erosion of patriotism that the author even poses
this question: “Should Communists know the verses of the
Star-Spangled Banner?”</p>

<p>This is how communism is working to promote an alien
way of life in America. The whole story, however, is still not
told. How are all these facets of Party life held together?
What gives a ruthless uniformity to Party actions? We must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
now turn to a study of Party discipline, a system of terror
that holds Party members in the grip of an unbelievable
tyranny.</p>

<i>Communist Discipline</i></h3>

</div>

<p>In communist eyes the processes of education, the press, and
“culture,” which we considered in the last chapter, are not
enough for molding the revolutionary. Important as they are,
they must be supplemented by <i>communist discipline</i>, a discipline
that enforces uniformity, ensures Party supremacy,
and files fanaticism to a sharp cutting edge.</p>

<p>Modern-day communism, in all its many ramifications,
simply cannot be understood without a knowledge of communist
discipline: how it is engendered, how it operates, how it
tears out man’s soul and makes him a tool of the Party. The
very core of communism is discipline. Without it communism
would lose much of its momentum, terror, and striking power.</p>

<p>The Party’s constitution provides for disciplinary action. An
elaborate “appeals” framework is provided whereby a series of
“courts” is available to hear “charges,” with the National
Convention being the “court” of final resort. Generally speaking,
disciplinary problems are handled, on all levels of the
Party, by Review and Control Commissions (often called
Security Commissions). They serve as the “courts” to discipline
any member who might be hostile to the Party.</p>

<p>These “courts” must not be confused with courts as we
know them in the American judicial system. Run by hardened,
old-time comrades, they are weapons of Party discipline. “Sentences”
are meted out on the basis of expediency, not justice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
Rules of evidence, the fair balancing of opinions, and the
seeking of truth play no role. Communist discipline is a repugnant
totalitarianism.</p>

<p>Here is the account of one victim of communist discipline.
John Lautner had been a member of the Communist Party for
more than twenty years. He had risen through the ranks until
he was a member of the National Review Commission of the
Communist Party; he headed the New York Review Commission,
was security officer for the Party headquarters building,
then at 35 East 12th Street, New York City. He considered
himself a dedicated member of the Party.</p>

<p>One day in January, 1950, he was told to proceed to Cleveland,
Ohio, to help in perfecting plans for the communist underground
in Ohio. Upon arrival he was taken ostensibly to a
Party meeting in the basement of a residence. There he was
ordered to remove his clothes and for a period of several hours
was subjected to the basest of indignities. He was told that he
would not leave alive as six other communists, who Lautner
said had “butcher knives,” “revolvers,” “rubber hoses,” and a
“recording machine,” started questioning him about his knowledge
of the underground, his army record, his relationship
with Hungarian defectees, and his reports to federal agencies.
He was accused of being an enemy agent, a spy, of hiring
unreliable people to work in the Communist Party defense
office, and protecting government “spies” in the Party.
Actually, Lautner was innocent of these charges, and the
Party’s injustice inured to the government’s benefit. Finally
Lautner had the presence of mind to state that he had left at
his hotel the name of one of the communist officials conducting
the star-chamber proceedings. He was released and
returned to New York, where he read in the <i>Daily Worker</i> that
he had been expelled from the Party as an enemy agent.</p>

<p>Lautner even filed an appeal of this expulsion order but
never received an answer. Several months later he came to the
FBI with his story for the first time and since has testified in
several legal proceedings. Such is the way communist “justice”
is dispensed in the United States.</p>

<p>In this connection we must distinguish between the discipline<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
that communism can exact when it is in state control, as
in Russia, Hungary, and China, and when it is not. Communists
in the United States cannot exact the death penalty;
they cannot operate slave labor camps; they cannot deport
families to isolated areas. Yet the disciplinary actions of the
Communist Party, USA, as we shall see in the “purge” of
Earl Browder in 1945, show unmistakably that communists in
this country think and would like to act in disciplinary matters
precisely as do communists behind the Iron Curtain. Moreover,
the stronger the Party in this country, the more able it
has been to enforce its discipline. Every Party member should
realize that, by working to strengthen the Communist Party,
he is thereby giving the Party greater power to discipline him
in the future. Today, at most he can be expelled and vilified,
unless he is subjected to the treatment given John Lautner.
We can readily conjecture, however, recalling the purge
trials under Stalin, what could happen here if communism
ever controlled our government.</p>

<p>Communist discipline is a part of the everyday life of the
Party. It is not something that can be developed overnight or
learned exclusively from a book. It comes gradually from attending
schools, reading, and doing Party work. A “conscience
of responsibility,” as one old-time member explained it, is
created; a feeling that, whatever your personal desires and
responsibilities, <i>the Party’s orders come first</i>; that every task is
surrounded by a Party “halo of sanctity,” thereby becoming
an emergency urgently demanding instant handling; that a
“guilty” feeling arises if the member relaxes for a moment or
doesn’t do the job assigned by the Party “boss.”</p>

<p>In the communist system, discipline means <i>conscious</i> and
<i>voluntary</i> submission to the will of the Party. To obey Party
instructions is regarded as a high ethical duty, to be undertaken
joyously and willingly as an honor and privilege, never
as bondage. Not to obey is unthinkable and a matter of personal
shame and Party irresponsibility. This is the terrifying
danger of communist discipline—that in the name of freedom,
by appealing to the most noble qualities in man, the human
being is pushed into deepest tyranny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>Communist “courts” seek out those who do not “knuckle
under” to communist discipline. If a mistake is made from bad
judgment, a lapse of memory, or lack of knowledge, that is one
thing. This can be corrected by more “education.” But if the
member persists in error, that is, doesn’t follow undeviatingly
the Party line, he must be “flayed without mercy.” “... an
organization of real revolutionaries,” says Lenin, “will stop at
nothing to rid itself of an undesirable member.”</p>

<p>Members may be disciplined for many reasons. One of the
most serious is being a <i>deviationist</i>, that is, differing from the
Party line. This charge has led to wholesale purges in the past,
including the ousting of such leaders as Lovestone, Gitlow,
Browder, and literally hundreds of lesser members.</p>

<p>The Party claims to be an “advanced” element, teaching the
noncommunist masses the “glories” of socialism. As leaders,
communists must be “in front” of the less informed yet not too
far ahead to be out of sight. Just where to be at any given
time is decided by the Party inner clique. Anyone disagreeing
is a deviationist, guilty of either <i>left-wing sectarianism</i> or
<i>right-wing opportunism</i>.</p>

<p>Some individuals, the communists say, may stray too far to
the left. They want the Party to be more militant, to hurry up
the revolution. They rush on ahead, forgetting to guide the
noncommunists. That’s wrong, says the Party. Such an attitude
would isolate the Party, make it an ineffectual sect. These individuals
are guilty of left-wing sectarianism. They must turn
around and come back.</p>

<p>On the other hand, many members lag behind the correct
position. They disregard the Party’s role as an “advanced
teacher” and allow it to work too closely with capitalism. They
are right-wing opportunists, equally as guilty as left-wing
sectarians. They had better rid themselves of this “capitalist
complex” and catch up.</p>

<p>These terms sound massive. To communists, however, they
are everyday expressions. Time after time in Party meetings
the charge will be heard, “He’s an opportunist,” or, “He’s a
left-wing sectarian.” To the communists that’s like calling a
man a thief or coward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>You can well imagine how these “errors” are corrected.
Disciplinary scythes can cut down anyone disliked by the
leadership. If you want to get rid of a comrade, accuse him
of left-wing sectarianism or right-wing opportunism. He’ll
probably then be hauled into Party “court.” Disciplinary
vogues sweep the Party: for a while, left-wing sectarianism
becomes popular, then right-wing opportunism. After Browder’s
removal in 1945 as a right-wing opportunist (also called
<i>revisionist</i>), the style was to criticize opportunism. Since the
Geneva Conference of 1955 the fashion has been to attack
left-wing sectarianism.</p>

<p>Another serious error is <i>chauvinism</i>, applied to a member
who supposedly thinks himself superior to others.</p>

<p>Any member can bring charges, no matter how silly, trivial,
and stupid. That’s a communist technique: always keep members
in fear. Never must a comrade become secure, complacent,
or unconcerned. He must constantly be worrying
about “what’s coming next.” This prevents the entrenchment
of Party bureaucrats and the formation of cliques; it makes
discipline easier to impose.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in his Party work or in his personal affairs, a member
has given more attention to Mr. A than to Mr. B. If Mr.
B’s feelings have been hurt, he may bring formal charges. In
one instance, a group of Party comrades made plans to hold
a picnic, then invited two additional comrades. The two declined,
saying that by being asked at the last minute they had
been slighted. Result: they planned to bring charges of
chauvinism.</p>

<p>There are different types of chauvinism. <i>White chauvinism</i>,
for example, means that a white comrade, through word or
deed, has “slighted” or shown that he feels himself better than
a Negro comrade. If the reverse is true—that a Negro member
considers himself superior to a white comrade—this leads to the
error of <i>inverted white chauvinism</i> or <i>Negro nationalism</i>.
Then there is <i>male chauvinism</i>, also called <i>male supremacism</i>,
when men comrades “look down on” the position of women.
In one instance a man was accused of disapproving of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
wife’s smoking. He was a male supremacist. If a woman thinks
she is superior to a man, that’s <i>commandism</i>.</p>

<p>Still another cause for disciplinary action is the charge of
being an <i>informer</i>. Ever since 1949, when FBI informants
testified at the first New York Smith Act trial, communists
have been terrified of informers. They go all-out to catch
“spies.” Member after member, completely innocent of the
Party’s charges, has been expelled. “If you have to kick ten
guys out to get the right one,” a comrade explained, “that’s
the way to do it.” In one instance Party officials without any
authority searched the home of a member “under suspicion.”
In another instance an anonymous letter was received at
national headquarters charging, among other things, that a
high Party official was “a big bag of wind.” The Party instantly
collected typewriting samples, hoping to catch the culprit.</p>

<p>The Party, as part of its disciplinary program, encourages
what is called self-criticism. The communists point to this
technique as proof of the democratic nature of their Party.
Actually, however, self-criticism plays into the hands of the
ruling clique, enabling it to detect discontent and criticism of
its leadership. It becomes an effective disciplinary technique
to keep the membership in submission.</p>

<p>Members are encouraged to criticize themselves and others.
A well-established Party admonition is: “Test your work
against Marxist-Leninist principles. Is anything wrong? Why
did the registration program fall short? Are the officers of the
club doing their duties properly? Why weren’t more pamphlets
sold?” The membership is expected to bewail its errors, to say,
“We were wrong. Have mercy on us. We will do better.”
They prostrate themselves before Party bosses. For those who
don’t “confess,” there are others to point out their errors. What
else could be asked?</p>

<p>When a comrade confesses, the communist custom is for
other members to heap abuse on him, often in the most sarcastic
and sneering manner. “You’re a deviationist.” “You’re a
chauvinist!” The idea is to drive the member to the lowest
depths of humiliation.</p>

<p>When Earl Browder was deposed in 1945, a national officer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
suggested that he be given a job scrubbing floors at national
headquarters. Browder later told the Yonkers, New York,
communist club, “If there had been any evidence that there
existed a real need for my services in this capacity, I would
gladly have given them.”</p>

<p>Members often work themselves into a state of frenzy, tearing
apart their best friends. Sometimes self-criticism becomes
contagious, with Party sections and committees confessing
en masse.</p>

<p>Tongues are sharp, but comrades soon learn whom to
criticize. To attack a fellow comrade, especially one you don’t
like, is the thing to do. In attacking the club chairman the
comrade had better take things a little slowly. If he is a friend
of the chairman’s superior and thinks he can get the chairman’s
job, then it’s proper. If not, he should be content with
self-criticism. Good Party manners would say “no” to disparaging
a state or national leader, unless one was assigned as
a “hatchet man” for another top official. Communist criticism
flows more safely downward than upward.</p>

<p>Criticism is encouraged—but it must be of the right kind.
An organizer isn’t doing his job. To criticize him is proper;
that’s <i>constructive criticism</i>, designed to make the Party
stronger. “But this criticism,” one high official said, “must
never depart from the line of the Party....”</p>

<p>That’s the crux: Criticism must be limited to how the Party
line can best be advanced. Anything else is <i>destructive
criticism</i>. It’s like a house full of furniture. A comrade is permitted
to discuss how the furniture can be arranged, whether
the blue chair should be in the front room or the bedroom.
But as soon as he questions the size of the house, whether a
new room should be added, or the entire house destroyed and
rebuilt, well, that’s too much. The Party line must not be
questioned.</p>

<p>Some members learn the hard way. They push criticism too
far and are quickly put in place.</p>

<p>John was highly regarded as a club chairman. He was
aggressive and a hard worker. Promotion was his reward. He
was sent by the National Committee to another city as a section<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
organizer. Soon things began to hum. He reorganized
some clubs. He shifted other Party activities. He was putting
his ideas to work.</p>

<p>Then he went one step too far. He suggested that the state
organization, headed by his superior, could be improved. John
should have known better. An organizer can work out new
schemes to sell the <i>Daily Worker</i>, to recruit members, and to
reshuffle clubs; in fact, that is Party initiative. But he doesn’t
criticize state chairmen and, as John did in this instance,
threaten to take up the matter directly with national headquarters.</p>

<p>John quickly became the fellow who “went up fast, down
faster.” State headquarters, in a special report, severely
criticized him and recommended additional Party training.
The result: He was recalled and assigned to an insignificant
desk job. He had to learn his lesson.</p>

<p>Destructive criticism may lead to <i>factionalism</i>, which, in
Party eyes, is open rebellion. A member holds a critical
opinion. Others agree and soon a faction, or group hostile to
the Party line, is formed. Every resource of the Party is
mobilized to destroy it.</p>

<p>For a show of democracy, the Party’s constitution says:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Every officer and member shall have the right to express a dissenting
opinion on any matter of Party policy with respect to
which a decision has been made by majority vote of the appropriate
Party committee or convention, <i>provided that such
dissenting officer or member does not engage in factional or
other activity which hinders or impedes the execution of such
policy</i>. [Emphasis supplied.]</p>

</div>

<p>In other words, in practice any criticism that “hinders” the
Party line is called factionalism and is forbidden.</p>

<p>Often, factionalism becomes so pronounced that an entire
group is expelled. The Communist Party, with its unreasonable
discipline and rigid structure, is peculiarly susceptible to factionalism.
There are in America today a number of Marxist
factions (called <i>splinters</i>), each small in number and with
varying degrees of hostility to the Communist Party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>Noncommunists will have difficulty in understanding the
utter inhumanity of communist discipline. It is a discipline
that pervades every facet of life, drives wedges between husband
and wife, and separates families. The best friends today,
because of a Party action, may become the bitterest enemies
tomorrow.</p>

<p>A Party member heard that her husband, a high-ranking
functionary, had just been expelled. The shock was terrific.</p>

<p>He claimed that he was innocent. “I didn’t do anything,”
he stated. And he was right. The charges were completely
false. But she refused to believe. She double-checked with
Party headquarters. They said he was guilty. The more she
thought about it, the angrier she became. Her eyes grew bitter
and her mouth curled with scorn. Finally her decision was
made.</p>

<p>“Get out of this house,” she ordered. “I don’t want you
around. You’re a traitor. Now, <span class="smcap">out</span>!”</p>

<p>Without hesitation she accepted the Party’s version, refusing
to believe her own husband. The wedge of Party discipline
had conquered. The husband was driven away from his own
home and his own child. Loyalty to the Party supersedes all
emotions of love and mercy and justice.</p>

<p>In California the parents of a young lady were Party members.
Both had held high offices in their section. They objected
to their daughter’s staying out with another Party member
until four and five o’clock in the morning, and claimed it was
injuring her health and her progress in school. The daughter’s
boy friend complained to a Party functionary that he was
being discriminated against because he was a Negro. The
girl’s mother, a former section chairman, defended her action.
The daughter then took the floor and charged her parents with
chauvinism. They were expelled and the daughter then married
the complainant.</p>

<p>The Party’s constitution provides a number of specific
penalties of increasing severity, including expulsion.</p>

<p>The mildest Party penalty is <i>reprimand</i>, usually designed to
assist Party members in correcting their mistakes. This may
take the form of <i>private censure</i>, such as, “You had better be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
on time in the future,” or, “Your work wasn’t well organized.”
Somewhat more severe is <i>public censure</i>, whereby through
written notice or public announcement a comrade is reprimanded.
In this way others know of the Party’s disapproval.</p>

<p>Then there is <i>probation</i>. This may involve a shift from one
type of work to another or an assignment to special tasks. If
the offender is a paid Party official, he may be demoted (for
example, from a state office to a minor position) or transferred
to another city. Next is <i>suspension</i>, usually for a specific length
of time. This amounts to a temporary relief of assignments.
The most severe penalty, next to expulsion, is <i>removal from
office</i>. In such instances the comrade may be stripped of all
Party assignments and demoted to being a mere rank-and-filer.
This is a hard jolt, especially with the whole Party watching.
These acts are object lessons to the membership. “Comrade,
be careful. Don’t you do the same.” Fear plays an important
role in communist discipline.</p>

<p>The most drastic penalty, of course, is <i>expulsion</i>, and thousands
of case examples, even of the highest leaders, form mute
evidence.</p>

<p>Once the communists turn on a comrade, the treatment is
complete. For example:</p>

<p class="tb">Earl Browder, onetime General Secretary, was expelled in
February, 1946, for</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... developing factional activity and for betraying the principles
of Marxism-Leninism and deserting to the side of the
class enemy—American monopoly capital.</p>

</div>

<p>Sam Donchin, Associate Editor, <i>Daily Worker</i>, until shifted
to leadership position on the Party’s Education Commission,
was also expelled. The <i>Daily Worker</i> on March 12, 1951, in
announcing his expulsion, said, “Donchin was expelled for
factionalism, anti-Party activities, hostility to the line of the
Party and to the Party leadership, and white chauvinism.”</p>

<p>The announcement continued: “Donchin tried to cover up
his factionalism in the name of criticism and self-criticism in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
the Party. He demagogically tried to identify criticism and
self-criticism in the ranks of the Party with a right to carry on
factional conduct in the Party.”</p>

<p>Once a former member breaks with the Party and testifies
or makes a public statement, he can expect a merciless campaign
of vilification. On April 10, 1952, the well-known stage
and screen director, Elia Kazan, appeared before the House
Committee on Un-American Activities and testified that he had
been in the Party for a year and a half in the 1930’s and quit
because of the regimentation and thought control that had
been directed at him. Two days later he took a paid advertisement
in the New York <i>Times</i> explaining his reasons. <i>Daily
Worker</i> writer Samuel Sillen on April 17, 1952, gave Mr.
Kazan the full treatment with such vitriolic words as:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">We have seen a lot of belly-crawling in this time of the toad,
but nothing has quite equaled last week’s command-performance
by Hollywood director Elia Kazan.... Not even in
Hitler days did renegade intellectuals sink so low.... Kazan
is not content with being a toad. He must also be a philosopher
of toadyism.</p>

</div>

<p>Communist discipline, however, is not blind or without a
deceitful purpose. Individuals should not be expelled impulsively
but should be shown the error of their ways. Only when
he is deemed “unimprovable” is a member to be ousted. For
this reason offenders are often compelled to perform special
“disciplinary chores” to “earn their way back,” to show
through hard work, devotion, and acknowledging the supremacy
of the Party that they should be readmitted to favor. In a
Northern city, for example, an official in disfavor was placed
in charge of arranging a mass meeting. He had to “prove”
himself by doing the most menial tasks—running errands, selling
tickets, recruiting ushers—he who used to be a keynoter
himself. In most instances the more menial the task, the better.
In Party eyes, a member who has gone through this self-abasement
becomes a better comrade because of it. All thought of
resistance is pounded out and he becomes a viable Party tool.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
He can be reprimanded, criticized, treated in a brutally unfair
manner, yet he’ll keep on working. Lash him, and he’ll
clench his teeth tighter. That’s the true revolutionary, in
communist eyes.</p>

<p>The key is always acknowledging the supremacy of the
Party. Hence, one of the fastest ways “back” is to acknowledge
it quickly and completely.</p>

<p>In a Midwestern section an old-time organizer was accused
of conduct detrimental to the Party. In a report read at an
executive committee meeting he admitted his error. His conduct
had been atrocious. Everything charged was true. He
should have known better. He was ready to accept punishment.
He even suggested his own removal as organizer. This
attitude was exactly what the Party wanted. The state office
did not relieve the organizer, though cautioning him that if
his conduct were repeated, more severe action would be
taken. The result: public (and mild) reprimand, not suspension
or removal from office.</p>

<p>This explains why, in some instances, severe errors receive
minor penalties, whereas small mistakes result in expulsion.
The test is often not what a member did wrong but his attitude
after the error was committed. If the member is willing
to admit his mistake, real or fictitious, accept punishment
gladly, and still maintain absolute faith in the leadership, he
will probably soon be restored to favor. If he tries, however,
to defend himself in the light of the evidence, he must be
dealt with harshly. On one occasion a member involved in
domestic difficulties replied “none of your business” to an inquiry
by the Party. He wasn’t long in good standing. In Party
language, he showed no “political capabilities,” meaning he
was not amenable to discipline.</p>

<p>The Communist Party has a systematic campaign of creating
hatred against the expelled member. It is not enough just
to expel him; he must be vilified, blackened, and made to appear
the scum of the earth.</p>

<p>These individuals become “spies,” “stool pigeons,” “rats,”
“Trotskyites,” “renegades,” and “degenerates.” To communists,
ordinary curse words have no meaning. They have a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
vocabulary all their own. Hence, “opportunist,” “deviationist,”
and “anti-Party” are their choicest terms of defamation, of
characterizing a person as being the meanest, foulest, most
black-hearted derelict imaginable.</p>

<p>The higher in Party leadership the ousted member has risen,
the greater must be the efforts to defame him. For example,
Robert Wood, the Party’s onetime Eastern railroad organizer,
was expelled with an explosive statement in the <i>Daily Worker</i>
on March 23, 1951, which said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... various violations of Party discipline, for panic in the face
of the fire of the class enemy, for acts endangering the Party,
for issuing instructions in the name of the Party which were
unauthorized and false, for acts of white chauvinism, and for
conduct unbecoming and inconsistent with his post of Party
leadership.</p>

</div>

<p>From the campaign of vilification there arises a fantastically
bitter element of communist discipline and hatred. Every man,
woman, and child in the membership must be mobilized
against the accused. One Party manual, written by a top
leader, recommended:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Photograph the spy, and print his picture in the <i>Daily
Worker</i> and in leaflets and stickers....</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Organize systematic agitation among the workers where the
spy was discovered.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Mobilize the children and women in the block in the part
of town where the stool pigeon lives to make his life
miserable; let them picket the store where his wife purchases
groceries and other necessities; let the children in
the street shout after him or after any member of his family
that they are spies, rats, stool pigeons.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Chalk his home with the slogan: “So-and-So who lives here
is a spy.” Let the children boycott his children or child;
organize the children not to talk to his children, etc.</p>

</div>

<p>This represents the utter depths of depravity, hate, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
inhuman venom to which the Party will descend in order to
wreak vengeance on an expelled member.</p>

<p>An expellee must have no association with any member of
the Party—even though that member be his own father,
mother, wife, or husband. “Associating with the enemy” is
the usual charge. This means the splitting of families, the
tearing apart of friends. In one instance a woman member was
expelled. Her husband was instructed to leave her and the
children. When he refused, he was expelled. Another member
who remained friendly was also ousted. It becomes a dizzy
merry-go-round of personal spleen.</p>

<p>Once a communist is expelled and there is a likelihood that
he might become a government witness, then the communists
go to work to compile such information as is available to discourage
the witness from testifying for fear of exposure or of
being discredited in cross-examination by a communist lawyer.
In one case a woman rose to a prominent position in the Party.
When she later left the Party, the communists reportedly compiled
a large file of her early indiscretions and weaknesses.
Consequently, she has always been most reluctant to testify.</p>

<p>Communist discipline has another facet often difficult for
noncommunists to understand. In some instances penalties,
expulsions, and exposure are not enough; the culprit must pay
with his life. Nothing less is satisfactory. The world has witnessed,
both in Russia and in the satellites, highly publicized
“purge” trials.</p>

<p>The “crime” was not opposition to the Party, lack of loyalty,
or unwillingness to sacrifice everything for communism.
Rather, these victims were renowned for their devotion, often
having spent their entire lives in the movement. Suddenly,
within days, their whole position was overturned. They were
accused of trying to destroy the very thing they had labored
so long to create. How does this make sense?</p>

<p>Communism is cannibalistic. Its servants are periodically
offered as sacrifices on the communist altar. If something goes
wrong, the trouble lies, in communist eyes, not in the policy
decreed on high but in its human instruments. Whenever the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
“infallible science” of Marxism-Leninism has been incorrectly
applied, disciplinary action must follow.</p>

<p>The purge is characteristic of the communist movement
everywhere. Lenin was a firm advocate of purges and urged:
“If we really succeed ... in purging our Party from top to
bottom, ‘without respect for persons,’ the gains for the revolution
will really be enormous.”</p>

<p>William Z. Foster, then Chairman of the Communist Party
in the United States, said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Communist parties, in line with Lenin’s teachings, also constantly
strengthen the fiber of their organization by cleansing
their ranks of elements that have become confused, corrupted,
worn-out, or defeated in the hard and complex struggle to
build the forces of socialism in the face of a still powerful and
militant capitalism.</p>

</div>

<p>A stocky, mustached man stood before the convention of the
Communist Political Association in 1945. A few days earlier
he had been the undisputed leader of communists in the
United States. He was now a “renegade,” an “enemy” of the
foulest proportions! Earl Browder was fighting for his Party
life.</p>

<p>Browder’s crime was not disloyalty to the Party but obedience
to a policy that, in his opinion, was in the best interests
of communism. Moscow thought otherwise. Actually, Browder
was a pawn of communist tactics and had to pay the penalty.</p>

<p>He was stripped of Party authority, accused of every conceivable
Party crime—by the very subordinates who had been
his most loyal supporters. He was later expelled ignominiously,
becoming a target of vilification for the entire membership.</p>

<p>Here was a “purge trial” grimly reminiscent, except for
bodily punishment, of the infamous purges under Stalin. We
need not wonder what Browder’s fate might have been if communism
had possessed the power of the state.</p>

<p>In our review of life in the Party we have seen how all communist
processes are pointed to molding the revolutionary. He
is the man who must carry out communist programs such as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
mass agitation, fronts, and infiltration, to which we now turn.
If anywhere he falters, from the Party’s point of view, the
communist drive for mastery is weakened.</p>

<p>The ousted member in most instances frees himself from
the communist thought-control machine. In him lies hope for
regeneration. The deepest tragedy lies in the conscious and
voluntary submission, day after day, of thousands of Party
members. These fanatical devotees, giving their all for the
Party, represent a real danger to our way of life.</p>

<i>Communist Strategy and Tactics</i></h3>

</div>

<p>In preceding chapters I have briefly outlined the history
and internal structure of the Communist Party, USA. Now we
must consider the Party’s attack against noncommunist society
in the United States.</p>

<p>The Communist Party, USA, is a weapon of attack, not only
for the day of revolution but for <i>now</i>. To Party leaders each
day is a day of preparation and dress rehearsal for the day
when they hope to come to power. Noncommunist ranks must
be infiltrated, penetrated, and subverted. The success of the
communist mission depends on capturing the enemy’s stronghold
from within.</p>

<p>To this end the Party employs a variety of <i>mass-agitation</i>
techniques. The communist is in the market places of America:
in organizations, on street corners, even at your front door. He
is trying to influence and control your thoughts. Mass agitation
weakens the noncommunist enemy and builds Party structure.</p>

<p>Communists conceive of their attack against capitalist society
in terms of warfare. They see the Party as the “vanguard,”
leading the proletariat in battle against the bourgeoisie.
Periods of offense and defense, attacks and retreats,
skirmishes, even pitched battles and casualties are demanded.
They realize that victory can be achieved only by force and
violence.</p>

<p>This warlike character of communist policy is reflected in
Party expressions such as “strongholds of reaction,” “mobilizing
the masses,” “advanced detachments of the proletariat,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
“storming the fortress of capitalism,” “seizing the initiative.”
Basic battle plans are conceived in terms of <i>strategy</i> and
<i>tactics</i>.</p>

<p>The ultimate aim of the Communist Party is the establishment
of a Soviet America. For more than a generation, never
for a moment have American communists forgotten their allegiance
to the Soviet Union. This is the ultimate strategy of
the Communist Party, USA.</p>

<p>Party leaders realize, however, that they are a minority.
They simply cannot march straight to victory. For that reason
the approach (tactics) must be varied, flexible, and constantly
subject to change.</p>

<p>To communists, strategy means the determining and carrying
out of long-range goals (such as winning a war), whereas
tactics are the working out of strategy on a day-to-day basis
(winning particular battles and engagements). “Tactics,”
Stalin said, “are a part of strategy, subordinate and subservient
to it.”</p>

<p>To achieve the long-range goal, retreats and maneuvers
sometimes are necessary. Is it not like climbing an unexplored
mountain? asks Lenin. How can we “renounce beforehand the
idea that at times we might have to go in zigzags, sometimes
retracing our steps, sometimes abandoning the course once
selected and trying various others?”</p>

<p>That explains the communist phrase, “strategic retreat.” It
means: Don’t be afraid to take two steps backward today if it
will help to achieve three steps forward tomorrow.</p>

<p>Keep the goal always in mind, teach the communists; remember
that the enemy is superior in numbers, better armed,
more experienced. Moreover, communists must be willing to
endure hardships. Lenin urged: “... if you are not inclined to
crawl in the mud on your belly, you are not a revolutionary
but a chatterbox....” Fight hard and be disciplined, “carefully,
attentively and skilfully taking advantage of every, even
the smallest ‘fissure’ among the enemies....” Seize “every,
even the smallest opportunity of gaining a mass ally, even
though this ally be temporary, vacillating, unstable, unreliable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
and conditional.” And “Those who do not understand this fail
to understand even a grain of Marxism....”</p>

<p>Use anything to advance the ultimate goal: offensive and
defensive tactics, legal and illegal, long- and short-range
policies. All are part of the over-all battle plan..</p>

<p>Don’t allow the Party to advance too rapidly. Stop, consolidate,
maintain contact with the masses. “... an advance <i>without
consolidating</i> the positions already captured is an advance
doomed to failure.” Likewise, never make a permanent truce
with the enemy. Don’t be trapped by his lures, bribes, and
promises. Cooperation or collaboration with noncommunists
must never be more than a “tactic.” It must have as its actual
long-range goal the weakening and discrediting of democracy
and its eventual destruction. The task of the revolutionary
leader is to gauge the comparative strength of the proletariat
and the bourgeoisie and decide what particular tactics are
then most likely to promote revolution.</p>

<p>Communists employ various tactics in devising methods to
inject themselves into various phases of American life. Their
obligation to defend the interests of the Soviet Union dictates
their tactics in seeking to obstruct and undermine public confidence
in our foreign policy. Thus, seizing upon the inherent
desire of all Americans to reduce taxes, the <i>Daily Worker</i>
editorializes that foreign aid should be curtailed and billions
should not be taken “out of our pockets for a new phony
‘emergency’.... The huge seventy-billion a year ‘defense’
budget is rushing America to inflation, and economic crisis.”
Actually, communists would like to develop an economic crisis.</p>

<p>Then they urge the development of a peacetime economy by
advocating trade between the United States and Russia because
Russia would benefit. <i>Political Affairs</i> thus urges, “The
only remaining untapped market for U.S. goods is the Soviet
Union, China and the Peoples’ Democracies, in which the
threat of crises of overproduction has been removed forever....”</p>

<p>In seeking to curry favor with labor, communists employ
tactics of calling for immediate demands such as higher wages,
a shorter work week, increased vacations, and an abolition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
the high cost of living. To that end a communist labor tactician
calls for putting “... ideological differences aside in order to
work together in behalf of a <i>single immediate objective</i> or a
<i>number of immediate objectives</i> ... the unions must work together....”</p>

<p>The immediate demand tactics are also employed by the
communists to find favor with Negroes by urging the abolition
of “Jim Crow Laws,” “full representation,” and “the fight for
Negro rights.” The controversy on integration has given the
communists a field day.</p>

<p>They also have a program “... to stimulate broad united-front
actions in the rural communities in defense of the
economic interests of the farming masses”; “to weld youth
unity”; and to “work still harder” for mothers.</p>

<p>A primary tactic of the Communist Party is to preserve the
legal status of the Party. Thus, any organization which has the
duty to investigate or expose communist activity is singled out
for attack. For years the Party has campaigned against the
House Committee on Un-American Activities, the Senate
Internal Security Subcommittee, and the Senate Investigating
Committee. The Department of Justice and the FBI have not
been spared, and we have come to judge our effectiveness by
the intensity of communist attacks.</p>

<p>The Red Fascists have long followed the practice of making
full use of democratic liberties: elections, lawful agitation and
propaganda, and free speech, press, and assembly. Their basic
premise: Reap every advantage possible. However, if it will
help, don’t hesitate to use illegal methods, such as underground
operations, terrorism, espionage, sabotage, lying,
cheating. “We have never rejected terror on principle, nor can
we do so. Terror is a form of military operation that may be
usefully applied....” wrote Lenin. Morality is strictly a bourgeois
device. To the communists everything that promotes the
revolution is moral, legal, and beautiful.</p>

<p>Many people are confused by the Party’s abrupt twists and
turns, such as denouncing the United States as an “imperialist”
nation from 1939 to 1941, then overnight, after Russia’s entrance
into the war, hailing America as a great ally. Communists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
often look like frightened rabbits chasing back and forth.
But in reality these “changes in the Party line” are merely
shifting tactics, all designed to promote the ultimate goal of
world revolution. They are not changes in heart.</p>

<p>The Communist Party, USA, has been and is engaged in an
all-out war against American freedom. Its tactics of confusion,
retreat, advance, infiltration, and hypocrisy are in full play.
The attack is both legal and illegal, offensive and defensive,
open and concealed.</p>

<p>Above the surface a gigantic propaganda and agitation
campaign is in progress, a campaign that depends for success
upon the support of noncommunists. Basic communist strategy
dictates that noncommunist hands, knowingly or unknowingly,
under communist guidance, must further the influence of the
communist world.</p>

<p>To understand communist strategy and tactics, as designed
to destroy American democracy, we must first observe <i>above-ground</i>
communist operations: mass-agitation campaigns, infiltration
techniques, and Party fronts; then in Part VI we will
consider the <i>underground</i> organization.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter box2b">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_15">15.<br>
<i>Mass Agitation</i></h3>

</div>

<p>As stated in Chapter 10, the Party’s attack is geared to the
wide variety of American life. Communism has something to
sell to everybody. And, following this principle, it is the function
of mass agitation to exploit all the grievances, hopes,
aspirations, prejudices, fears, and ideals of all the special
groups that make up our society, social, religious, economic,
racial, political. Stir them up. Set one against the other. Divide
and conquer. That’s the way to soften up a democracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>Here is the advice of a top leader giving instruction on how
to spread the Party’s influence:</p>

<p>Study your friends. See what they spontaneously talk about.
What problems interest them?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—is he an unemployed worker, skilled in his craft but without work?;</p>

<p class="hanging">—a storekeeper? Maybe business isn’t so good;</p>

<p class="hanging">—a trade-union man or a dairy farmer? What are their problems?;</p>

<p class="hanging">—a young man just out of school? Looking for a job?;</p>

<p class="hanging">—a member of a minority group?;</p>

<p class="hanging">—a young mother worrying about sending her child to kindergarten?</p>

</div>

<p>“... unless each one of us grasps the meaning of this individual
approach to every one of our friends and acquaintances,
we are in danger” of being ineffective.</p>

<p>Agitation must be carried on in specialized fields: among
women, among youth, among veterans, among racial and
nationality groups, farmers, trade unions. That’s the responsibility
of the Party commissions.</p>

<p>Consider youth, a prime target of communist attack. Communists
start out with this major premise: American imperialism
aims to create a corrupt, completely militarized youth—a
“gagged,” “scared” generation. This theme is expounded by
word of mouth, in forums, in literature, in cartoons, hoping to
exploit the lofty dreams of youth.</p>

<p>The approach always has two sides: (1) <i>the deceptive line
designed for public consumption</i>, and (2) <i>the real Party line
designed to advance communism</i>. Consider this <i>deceptive
line</i> for youth:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Increase trade with all countries, including the communist
bloc, to provide “hundreds of thousands of new jobs for
young people.”</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Outlaw all mass destruction weapons (atomic bomb).</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Promote universal disarmament and peace.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Reduce military expenditures and repeal the draft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p class="hanging">5. Repeal all “repressive legislation” and “restore the Bill of
Rights.”</p>

<p class="hanging">6. “Restore full academic freedom for students and faculties.”</p>

<p class="hanging">7. Promote world-wide “youth friendship for peace and
democracy,” drop all bars to the travel of youth.</p>

<p class="hanging">8. Appropriate more money for schools, community centers,
etc.</p>

</div>

<p>That is the line designed for public consumption. Sounds
acceptable, doesn’t it? But the communists are not genuinely
interested in improving the status of American youth.</p>

<p>For window-dressing, they always support items desired by
most of the people: lower taxes, higher wages, better housing,
old-age security, higher farm income. These are thoroughly
legitimate interests. To support these aims, and many others,
is not to be a communist. The Party is simply attempting to
exploit such interests for its own selfish aims They become
Party “talking points.”</p>

<p>Behind this front, as in the call for world-wide youth friendship,
more education, academic freedom, and so on, lurks the
ulterior motive, the real Party line. The attractive “come
along” points are merely bait. Look closely to see how the
adoption of these demands, <i>as conceived by the Party</i>, would
distort their true meanings and aid the communist cause:</p>

<p>“<i>Restore the Bill of Rights</i>,” in communist language, means
eliminating of legal opposition to communism, stopping all
prosecution of communists, and granting amnesty to those
presently in jail. “<i>Repeal the draft law</i>” and “<i>peace</i>” mean curtailing
our national defense effort and allowing Russia to become
militarily stronger than the United States. “<i>Increase
trade with the Soviet Bloc</i>” means selling materials that could
be used by the communist nations for armaments. “<i>Restore
academic freedom</i>” means to communists that we should permit
the official teaching of communist doctrine in all schools
and that we should allow communists to infiltrate teaching
staffs. If the communists had their way, America would be
rendered helpless to protect herself. Incidentally, notice the
communist use of the word “restore,” indicating that freedom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
is already gone and that the Party stands for its return.</p>

<p>Now substitute “veterans” for “youth.” The approach is the
same: Increased trade with all countries, including the communist
bloc, would mean thousands of new jobs for <i>veterans</i>.
“Restore” academic freedom so <i>veterans</i> can think as they
want. Promote world-wide <i>veteran</i> friendship. Drop all bars
to the travel of <i>veterans</i>. Also, it is good propaganda policy to
add a few “come along” points appealing specifically to
veterans. The technique continues: substitute “women,” “trade
union members,” “nationality groups,” etc.</p>

<p>The propaganda platform contains a combination of immediate
“come along” demands, designed for deceptive and
specialized appeal, and basic policy aimed to advance the
communist cause.</p>

<p>Thus the Party, through its specialized and immediate
demands, is able to gain entree into various groups and create
favorable working conditions for future revolutionary action.
Very quickly, for example:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—a veterans’ meeting endorses “peace.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—a nationality festival passes a resolution for “peace.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—a youth affair favors “peace.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—a neighborhood group comes out for “peace.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—a women’s rally fights for “peace.”</p>

</div>

<p>Whatever its composition, the group, once under communist
control, is switched to the Party line. The feigned interest in
legitimate demands is merely a trap.</p>

<p>Even holidays are used to enhance the Party’s aims. For
example, the <i>Daily Worker</i> once headlined a story “Mother’s
Day to Be Marked by Peace Tables....” Postcards should be
distributed on Mother’s Day, the story continued, “declaring
the deepest need of all American mothers to be a ban on A-
and H-bombs....”</p>

<p>Also planned, according to the story, were special Mother’s
Day leaflets and placards as well as balloons for the children
reading “World-Wide Ban of A- and H-bombs.”</p>

<p>Many people sincerely believe, for many reasons, that these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
bombs should be banned. However, to communists, the true
meaning of peace and banning the A- and H-bombs is weakening
the United States and advancing Russian aggressive aims.</p>

<p>And so it goes. A discussion may start about the low price of
oats, better working conditions on the second shift, equal pay
for women, the death rate among Eskimos, but it will end with
the endorsement of “peace”; “amnesty for the Smith Act
victims”; “repeal of the Internal Security Act of 1950 and the
McCarran-Walter Immigration and Nationality Act.”</p>

<p>Scattered, variegated, and inarticulate interests, under Party
guidance, are brought into a common denominator: support
for the Party line.</p>

<p>The Party line, in fact, is the sum total of all Party demands
at any given time. You must learn to see it as a whole. Some
demands are always present and seem innocent enough, such
as those for higher wages, lower taxes, and better housing.
But, remember, communists don’t really care about genuine
social reforms. These immediate demands are strictly for agitational
purposes. They serve to arouse people and to cause
tension. William Z. Foster says very candidly: “Our Party is a
revolutionary Party. It aims not simply to ease conditions a bit
under capitalism for the workers but to abolish capitalism altogether.”</p>

<p>If ever achieved, these demands will be restated in more
extreme form.</p>

<p>Other demands in the Party line are short-term; that is, they
may quickly change, depending on the current national and
international situation. Consider the Party’s stand that Formosa
should be returned to China proper. Suppose the present
communist regime in China were overthrown and a government
hostile to Soviet Russia gained power. This demand
would be quickly abandoned. On the other hand, certain demands
never change, such as support of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The attack is primarily agitational. Propaganda, although
valuable, is a long-range softener, to be handled chiefly on an
intellectual level by the educational department; agitation is
immediate, inflammatory, conducive to acute discontent, the
specialty of the field organizer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p>Lenin’s distinction is decisive. A propagandist, he says, to
explain unemployment must talk about the capitalist nature of
the crisis, the need for building a socialist society, etc. “‘Many
ideas’” must be expounded, “so many indeed that they will be
understood as a whole only by a (comparatively) few persons.”</p>

<p>But the agitator, on the other hand, selects one well-known
aspect of the problem, such as “the death from starvation of
the family of an unemployed worker.” He will concentrate on
imparting a single idea to the masses: why this family died.
Or, in Lenin’s words, he will show “the senseless contradiction
between the increase of wealth and increase of poverty.”
Evoke discontent and revolt <i>now</i>. “Leave a more complete explanation
... to the propagandist.” Here is an example of how
agitation works:</p>

<p>The communists publish a story: John Doe has been arrested,
the charge is murder. Of course it is a tragic event.
Crime always brings sorrow. It reflects maladjustment in society
and points up abuses that genuinely need correction. But
the communists aren’t interested in John Doe. They do not try
to discover the true facts in his case, study his background,
or improve his condition. Here in the day’s news is a human
tragedy that can be exploited for propaganda purposes. That
is enough.</p>

<p>The Party machinery springs into action, typical of thousands
of mass-agitation campaigns.</p>

<p>The communist press publicizes the case with pictures, an
interview with the wrongdoer, stories about his family. It carries
heart-rending and sentimental accounts, without regard to
truth or the suffering of the victim of the crime or the sorrow
of his loved ones.</p>

<p>If the arrested person is a member of a minority group, or
a veteran, the father of ten children, a union member or unemployed,
the agitational appeal is broadened. “Union Member
Framed on Murder Charge.” “Unemployed Veteran Railroaded
to Jail.” “Father of 10 Arrested on False Charges.”
Almost always the charge of “police brutality” is thrown in
too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>In a few days a decision must be made. Should the campaign
continue? Maybe the case is quickly over, no special interest
having been aroused. Or the “victim” himself announces
that he’s been treated fairly and has no personal ill feelings.
That’s the end. The Party drops it.</p>

<p>Such campaigns are sometimes carried on for months or
years, with varying degrees of intensity. The Party is a self-appointed
collector of “victims” of “framed evidence,” “lynch
justice,” “Gestapo brutality,” “academic witchhunts.” These
“martyrs of injustice” include old-timers like Sacco and Vanzetti
and the Scottsboro Case, now remembered only in
“memorials”; and recent ones, such as the “Martinsville
Seven,” the “Trenton Six” or the Rosenbergs; or hot-off-the-griddle
varieties, such as those appearing in the current Party
press. All are trotted out at the slightest twist of tongue or
pencil as exhibits of capitalist “terror” and communist “benevolence.”</p>

<p>Certain exploitation standards determine whether the campaign
is to continue: Can large numbers of people be influenced?
Is a public official involved—the more prominent the
better—who can be undermined and smeared? Will other communist
ventures be aided? Can the Party gain recruits? (Mass
agitation is always linked to Party building.) Can financial
gains be secured for the Party?</p>

<p>The Party searches American life for agitational points: the
eviction of a family, the arrest of a Negro, a proposed rise in
transit fares, a bill to increase taxes, a miscarriage of justice,
the underpayment of a worker, the dismissal of a teacher, a
shooting by law-enforcement officers. Some of the cases, unfortunately,
do reflect mistakes or blemishes in American
society. Others are twisted by the Party into agitational items.</p>

<p>Once the decision has been made to continue the campaign,
the next step is probably the formation of the XYZ Committee
to Save John Doe: a communist front, born at 9:00 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, full
grown by 10:30 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, mailing out letters by noon. This gives
the illusion of organized interest, focuses attention, and masks
communist participation. Purpose (deceptive) is to gain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
“justice” for the defendant; purpose (real): to advance communism.</p>

<p>Attract attention by building up a bonfire of agitation.
Suddenly, almost like magic, a “women’s” group in Oregon,
a “farmers’” meeting in Oklahoma, a “consumers’” conference
in West Virginia pass resolutions: “Save John Doe!” Literature
is scattered, other groups contacted. The Party becomes the
agitational base. Who is John Doe? The members don’t know,
except that he’s the newest twist in the Party line. That’s
enough!</p>

<p>The Party has now started a mass-agitation campaign. Its
success depends on securing noncommunist support. Members
contact community leaders, such as judges, members of the
city council, doctors, lawyers, clergymen, educators, social
workers, trying to obtain statements or testimonials.</p>

<p>The communist is no longer a shadowy figure deep underground
or meeting secretly at night. He is knocking on doors,
seeing prominent people, attending city council meetings.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">I feel that John Doe has been wrongly arrested [or convicted,
as the case may be]. I am compelled in the interests of justice
to demand that he be released.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">That is a typical testimonial to be sent to authorities and the
press.</p>

<p>The technique of obtaining testimonials is always to start
with a sympathizer, the kind who will authorize his name for
any communist campaign. Some are so “controlled” that headquarters
uses their names without consultation, even preparing
their statements. Others are contacted on each occasion.</p>

<p>They next reach out for other prominent sympathizers.
Officers of communist fronts make good signers. They usually
have imposing “titles.” Next, branch out to the lukewarm,
those who are on the fence; sometimes they will sign, other
times they will not. If not, they must be sold. Finally come the
unsuspecting noncommunists, with contact being made either
in person or on the telephone.</p>

<p>“Mr. X, I’m So-and-So from the XYZ Committee to Save<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
John Doe. I was just over at Mr. Y’s office. You know him,
don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” will come the reply. That gets the interview off to a
good start.</p>

<p>“This is a case I am sure will interest you. You are a lawyer
and here is an individual who is the victim of injustice....
Have you heard about it?”</p>

<p>“No.” That’s good, the field is clear.</p>

<p>On and on. “Dr. F, Rev. O, etc., have given statements....”</p>

<p>The man signs. Another “innocent victim.” Did he know the
communist identity of the solicitor? No. Did he know that the
XYZ Committee to Save John Doe was a communist front?
No. Did he realize that by making the statement he was aiding
the communist movement? No.</p>

<p>For sincere, honest reasons of their own, entirely unrelated
to communism, many individuals may support John Doe. This,
of course, does not make them communists. To call them
communists is an injustice, but it is not unjust to point out that
the Party always seeks to exploit such personal convictions for
partisan propaganda.</p>

<p>The cause of communism must be linked with as many
elements in society as possible. Our fight for John Doe is your
fight, the communists say to labor unions, Negro, professional,
cultural, and nationality groups. Today he’s being “persecuted.”
Tomorrow it’ll be your turn. Join with us and we’ll
fight together.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... we Communists join with every other democratic-minded
American, irrespective of views, in the common fight to preserve
a common democratic heritage.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent"><i>Deceptive</i>: the communists are fighting for our “common
democratic heritage”; <i>real</i>: to gain the support of noncommunist
groups (even “... those who do not accept Socialism as
a final aim”). As Lenin instructed, seize allies everywhere. Use
them for the advantage of furthering communism.</p>

<p>Mass agitation is most effective in capturing the support of
noncommunists. By securing even the temporary allegiance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
an individual, as in a testimonial, the Party gains. In this way
communist propaganda enters the orbit of that individual’s
personal influence. “Why,” a friend will say after reading the
testimonial, “if So-and-So endorses that organization [or
issue], it must be OK.” The dupe becomes a communist
thought-control relay station. That’s why communists are always
eager to secure the support of doctors, clergymen,
teachers, and other persons highly respected in their communities.
The more widely known the person, the better.</p>

<p>Circulating petitions is another favorite communist technique
for capturing noncommunist support.</p>

<p>A young woman stands on the sidewalk. A housewife, carrying
a package, comes out of the grocery store.</p>

<p>“Pardon me,” the young woman says, approaching her.
“Wouldn’t you like to help a young man win his freedom?”</p>

<p>The appeal is attractive. The housewife stops. “We have a
petition to the governor asking for the release of John Doe.
He’s sentenced to die....” The housewife looks at the petition.
It contains nothing communist. There is no hammer or
sickle or mention of Russia. It is just a statement that we the
undersigned believe that John Doe should be released. “You
can help a lot by signing....”</p>

<p>She signs and so do thousands of others. Party teams are
everywhere, on street corners, at factory gates, in bus terminals.
Sign here, please. Won’t you send a telegram or write
a letter? Here’s a sample all fixed up. Just sign it. Would you
like a leaflet? Won’t you call the governor’s office? Come to our
rally tonight. Write a letter to the newspaper. Is your club
meeting soon? Have it pass a resolution. Your pastor can help.
Have him call a protest meeting.</p>

<p>The pressure is tabulated in thousands of letters, resolutions,
and telegrams, ten, a hundred times the number of all Party
members in the United States.</p>

<p>Agitation campaigns are of all types, local, state, and
national:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—dealing with the high cost of living;</p>

<p class="hanging">—against a rise in transit fares;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p class="hanging">—opposing a bill in Congress or a state legislature;</p>

<p class="hanging">—protesting the showing of a “Fascist” movie;</p>

<p class="hanging">—demanding “peace”; “repeal the draft”; “more aid to schools”;</p>

<p class="hanging">—protesting the arrival in town of some celebrity not liked by the Party.</p>

</div>

<p>Campaigns involving court cases as a general rule provide
the most sustained agitation. These can be divided into various
<i>exploitation stages</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">1. <i>The arrest stage</i>: the “victim” has been illegally arrested.
The charges are “trumped up.”</p>

<p class="tb">2. <i>The trial stage</i>: “false evidence” is being used, the jury is
“packed,” a fair trial is “impossible.”</p>

<p class="tb">3. <i>The appeal stage</i> (assuming that the defendant is found
guilty): in most cases a guilty verdict serves the communist
purpose best. Otherwise, little propaganda is left, except for a
few self-congratulatory articles. The communists use every
device, inside and outside the courtroom, to break down the
American judicial system.</p>

<p class="tb">4. <i>The clemency stage</i>: this is probably best suited to agitation.
The Party operates a whole series of tactics. Here are a
few:</p>

<p class="tb">Mass meetings. Rallies. Demonstrations. Picket lines. These,
also used in other exploitation stages, now become imbued
with “gravity.” “John Doe Will Die in 2 Weeks. Wire the Governor.
Demand His Release.” “Save My Boy, Please. He’s Innocent.”
“Where’s America’s Conscience? This Man Has Been
Framed.”</p>

<p>Sojourns. Treks. Pilgrimages. Motorcades. Encampments.
The convergence on a selected spot, the state capital or Washington,
D.C., of members and sympathizers from all over the
country.</p>

<p>They arrive by train, battered old trucks, rented buses,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
hitchhiking. Get your tickets, meet at the station, don’t miss
the Clemency Train. Day after day the <i>Daily Worker</i> pounds
this theme. An operational headquarters is set up, usually
under a fancy Aesopian name such as “Liberty House” or
“Inspiration Center.”</p>

<p>This tactic—concentrated pressure—is reserved only for
special occasions. Teams visit offices of legislators, officials of
the government, and demand to see the governor or President.
Make everyone think that “millions” are demanding clemency.
A cascade of telegrams, letters, petitions, resolutions pours in,
promoted by comrades back home. “The city was stirred today
by the <i>nation’s</i> demand for clemency for John Doe....” writes
the Party’s press agent. Probably 250 communists and their
sympathizers were in town.</p>

<p>The hour of judicial decision or execution nears. The drama
is heightened. “Prayer meetings” are held by communists, who
do not believe in prayer. Then the super climax: a “vigil.”
The comrades start a marching line, twenty-four hours around
the clock, demanding “mercy,” “clemency.” One day, two
days, five days, twelve days, the line moves back and forth in
front of the governor’s mansion, or more dramatic, the White
House. Placards read: “Mercy for John Doe.” “Mr. Governor,
Don’t You Have a Heart?” Any testimonials secured from
prominent individuals bob and weave in the marching line.
Leaflets are handed out.</p>

<p>In two hours comes a new shift. Paraders walk silently,
sometimes in single file, at other times two abreast, usually six
to eight feet apart. This isn’t supposed to be a flamboyant
affair, but sad and mournful, designed to capture the emotions.
Death is near! “Clemency <i>Now</i>—Only 12 Hours Left.”
“Can America Allow an Innocent Man to Die?”</p>

<p>The shift is over. The members whisk back to “Liberty
House,” grab a bite to eat, hear a pep talk, then return for
another “tour of duty.” Cots are available for sleep. In this way
a few fanatical comrades can attract the attention of thousands.
Over the week end other comrades, off from work,
“flood” into a city and, in the flaming words of the Party press,
march by the “thousands”—meaning probably 250 to 300.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
“There’s Still Time to Act. Send Telegrams, Letters to the
Governor.” Mount the pressure. So long as John Doe is alive he
must be exploited.</p>

<p class="tb">5. <i>The imprisonment stage</i>: the defendant becomes a showpiece.
He is visited by his wife (called a “prison wife”) and
his family, and delegations go to see him. Sentimental and
heart-tearing accounts are written: “... as the train sped me
northward, my eyes ached with unwept tears of loneliness.”
“I heard [his] quiet voice. I looked into his calm eyes. But I
noted too the tight lines of controlled grimness about his
mouth and the narrowed tightness about his eyes.”</p>

<p>Birthday-card campaigns are initiated. Send John Doe a
Christmas greeting. His picture is published. His “speeches”
become “quotable scripture.” A nine-year-old son visits him
... the child is shocked by the “watchtowers,” “gigantic
searchlights,” “locked iron doors” ... the visit is over ... the
little boy tells his mother, “After all, if Daddy didn’t have such
good political ideas he wouldn’t be there in the first place.”
(He is a Smith Act “victim.”)</p>

<p>The communist press will invariably superimpose its judgment
on that of a jury and judge with a trumped-up charge
that the homicide was justifiable, the evidence framed, or the
witness had committed perjury. It will have a defense for the
crime that would cause the person not familiar with the facts
or the record of the trial to wonder. And the longer the lapse
of time, the more real the trumped-up defense will sound to
the uninformed. This might go on for years. For example, the
Women’s Committee for Equal Justice was not disbanded
until seven years after Rosa Lee Ingram and her two sons had
been convicted and sentenced in a Georgia court for the slaying
of a neighbor.</p>

<p class="tb">6. <i>The post-imprisonment stage</i>: most of the propaganda
value is generally gone when this stage is reached. If the
“victim” is dead, “memorial” services may occasionally be held
or articles written.</p>

<p>The cycle has run. The campaign may be dropped at any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
moment, shifted to a new tack, used to buttress another approach.
Another purpose, especially in espionage cases, is to
make the “victim” think he is a “martyr” and believe that any
cooperation with the American government, such as implicating
others or giving vital information, would be a betrayal.
Better to have him executed by the government for his crimes
than to expose other communists.</p>

<p>These campaigns are designed to dramatize communists and
their front representatives as “champions” of the masses. They
foster the illusion that these individuals are progressive, enlightened,
and humanitarian, acting in the best interests of the
American people. “We stand for freedom when everybody
else is not interested.” That is the illusion.</p>

<p>The real motive is to prepare both the Party and noncommunist
society for revolutionary action. Members gain experience
in mass work: the art of propaganda and agitation,
organizing social discontent, guiding large numbers. Leadership,
discipline, and organizational structure can be tested.
Moreover, communists hope to make workers and the masses
class-conscious, accepting the Party as their leader (in Party
terms called <i>radicalizing</i> the masses). Sow seeds of discontent;
weaken, divide, and neutralize anticommunist opposition;
above all, undermine the American judicial process.</p>

<p>Law enforcement has long been a target of communist attack.
As legal opposition crystallized, these Party attacks,
especially on the FBI, prosecutive officials, and police, have
mounted in intensity.</p>

<p>Lenin taught that it was essential for every “real people’s
revolution” to destroy the “ready-made state machinery.”
Wherever communists have been able to exercise any measure
of control, their first step has been to hamstring and incapacitate
law enforcement.</p>

<p>The communist performance in the Indian state of Kerala
is a good illustration. Within a few months after a procommunist
government came into control, “people’s action committees”
were formed which began to usurp the functions of
the law courts. Then the state police were handcuffed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
orders to stand on the sidelines except when crimes such as
murder, rape, arson, and assault occurred. Many communists
were freed from jail, and public statements were issued that
many penal institutions would be closed and their grounds
turned into flower gardens. A noncommunist official of the
Indian government reported a “complete breakdown of law
and order.”</p>

<p>Experience over the years has demonstrated that every time
communists are able to avert justice through technicalities,
there is not only jubilation in Party circles but also increased
urgings for more brazen Party action.</p>

<p>Day-to-day struggles are battle-hardening dress rehearsals
for revolution. William Z. Foster boasted, “... capitalism will
die sword in hand, fighting in vain to beat back the oncoming
revolutionary proletariat.”</p>

<p>Often communists find it effective to carry out their agitation
campaigns through organizations not generally recognized
as procommunist. These can be either (1) old-time organizations
which have been “infiltrated,” or (2) newly established
communist fronts. The next two chapters will discuss these
forms of communist campaigning.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter box2b">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_16">16.<br>
<i>Infiltration</i></h3>

</div>

<p>Infiltration is the method whereby Party members move
into noncommunist organizations for the purpose of exercising
influence for communism. If control is secured, the organization
becomes a communist front. This chapter shows how infiltration
works and what you can do about it.</p>

<p>Infiltration is one of the oldest of communist tactics, advocated
by Lenin and Stalin. For instance, listen to this exhortation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
by Georgi Dimitroff, General Secretary, before the
Seventh World Congress of the Communist International:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Comrades, you remember the ancient tale of the capture of
Troy. Troy was inaccessible to the armies attacking her, thanks
to her impregnable walls. And the attacking army, after suffering
many sacrifices, was unable to achieve victory until with
the aid of the famous Trojan horse it managed to penetrate to
the very heart of the enemy’s camp.</p>

</div>

<p>Homer’s famous story, Dimitroff said, must be applied to
the twentieth century. “We ... should not be shy about using
the same tactics....” The Trojan horse has enabled the Party
to wield an influence far in excess of its actual numbers.</p>

<p>For example, a community emergency occurred and assistance
was badly needed in a stricken area. A labor union in
Cleveland, Ohio, raised money to purchase food for distribution
to the victims of this adversity in a small West Virginia
town where families actually were in want for the necessities
of life. The Communist Party organizer in Cleveland instructed
a concealed Party member of the union that the truck
driver was to deliver the food to a specified address in the
stricken area in West Virginia where it would do the most
“good.”</p>

<p>Here a noncommunist organization was paying the bill,
thinking that it was doing a generous act of charity. Yet concealed
communists within its ranks were subverting the generosity
to communist ends. Since the Party had actual control
over the distribution, who do you think got credit for the
generosity?</p>

<p>Such incidents are frequent. Strikes have been called or
settlements influenced by Party penetration within labor
unions. Party manipulation has controlled the conventions of
noncommunist organizations and determined the selection of
officers. An idea originated in a Party office can, through this
technique, be translated within days or hours into interviews
with high government officials, into intensive agitation campaigns,
or even, as has happened, into disruption of industrial
production.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>No wonder the Party desperately seeks to infiltrate labor
unions, the government, civic and community groups, religious,
professional, economic, and social organizations. It
desires to make these organizations, in various ways, serve
Party interests.</p>

<p>Party leaders spend much time and effort in studying infiltration
strategy and tactics. A hasty, ill-advised, or poorly
timed move might wipe out months of preparation. Should the
objective be complete capture of the organization or the placing
of a few key members? If the latter, where should the
initial attack be delivered? Would it be better to place a member
on the midnight or on the swing shift? Where can the
greatest and most immediate gains be secured? A flexible
strategy, adapted to current conditions, must be employed.</p>

<p>Communists have probably worked harder to infiltrate
American labor unions than any other group. Since the days
of Lenin, labor has been a favorite target. The Russian dictator
was explicit:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">It is necessary to ... agree to any and every sacrifice, and even—if
need be—to resort to all sorts of stratagems, manoeuvres
and illegal methods, to evasion and subterfuges in order to
penetrate the trade unions, to remain in them, and to carry on
Communist work in them at all costs.</p>

</div>

<p>The statement is frank: Communists are not interested in
the laboring man, higher wages, better working conditions,
shorter hours. They want to get inside unions in order to
agitate for communism.</p>

<p>An overwhelming majority of American labor-union members
are honest, hard-working, loyal citizens. They detest
communism. This has been proven time after time. Alerted to
the presence of communists, they will cast them out. Most of
the Party’s gains achieved prior to and during World War II
in the labor movement have now been destroyed.</p>

<p>These defeats, however, have not halted the danger. “At
least 90 per cent of all of our efforts,” one Party writer asserted,
must be devoted to industrial workers. Drawing on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
years of experience, the Party is today attacking labor unions
with renewed vigor. The best way to defeat this assault is to
know communist tactics of action.</p>

<p>The first thing in labor-union infiltration tactics is to secure
a foothold inside a union, through a single comrade or, better
yet, two or three. Comrades then do everything possible to
build up strength inside the organization, creating a shop club.</p>

<p>Members of shop clubs are expected to promote Party
influence in all possible ways. Very important is the recruitment
of new members. The Party’s influence depends on
members, especially on their strategic placement in the union
and in industry.</p>

<p>“How-to-recruit” suggestions, for example, are often supplied
to shop comrades. One Party manual urges that members
mix with the workers and cultivate friendships.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Especially must the Communist mingle with his fellow workers
at noon time and participate in the general discussions and
conversations that take place.</p>

</div>

<p>Always try to steer these discussions, the manual says, into
“economic and political channels”—so as to provide the chance
to insert communist propaganda. And don’t use technical
Party terms. Learn to express “our Marxian line” in good
“American slang.” Communism can best be sold in the everyday
language of the prospect.</p>

<p>If the worker shows “interest” (the communists say if “he’s
more advanced”), give him a <i>Daily Worker</i> or pamphlet to
read. Then invite him to a meeting or “study group.”</p>

<p>Try to stay with him after working hours. “The majority of
our Party members become Communists only after working
hours, around 6 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>” For communists there is no such thing
as an eight-hour day.</p>

<p>The over-all work of infiltration, especially of shop clubs, is
coordinated by Party strategy caucuses; that is, Party-called
meetings where the problems of infiltration are studied. They
are generally held on an industry basis, such as the automobile,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
steel, railroad, mining, and electrical industries, with
members employed in these fields attending.</p>

<p>Party caucuses operate on different levels. There will be,
for example, local caucuses of Party members employed in a
certain industry in a given area, such as the automobile or
electrical industry in Detroit or Cleveland. Then there are
state and national caucuses, with Party leaders being drawn
from wider areas. Party labor directors are usually in charge.
In the past, for instance, national “auto” caucuses were often
held in Cleveland or Detroit, “steel” in Youngstown, “electrical”
in Buffalo, and “mining” in Pittsburgh. Sometimes Party
leaders in related unions, such as automobile and steel, are
brought together in a general communist labor conference.</p>

<p>These caucuses are literally strategy-devising meetings,
where problems and procedures are analyzed with X-ray precision.
Noncommunists probably do not realize how carefully
communists study “capitalist” companies, wage policies, personnel,
etc. The objective always is: How can the company
and the union be used to implement the Party line, as support
for “peace,” the Smith Act “victims,” or some current Party
“martyr”?</p>

<p>For an answer let’s look in on one Party caucus.</p>

<p>Leslie, from the northwestern part of the state, was reporting
on what his shop club was doing, that is, soliciting signatures
to a “peace” petition.</p>

<p>“We got seven hundred and four signatures in a little over
three days last week.”</p>

<p>“Keep at it,” the organizer responded. “Get more signature
campaigns going. Contact those people who have already
signed. See if they are friendly and understand our position.
If so, go a third time. (Maybe a recruit could be secured.)
Encourage them to circulate a petition themselves.”</p>

<p>“At our plant,” another Party leader commented, “we
started a committee to protect freedom of speech. It’s a good
issue and we’ve had some fine response. I think we ought to
soon rally some support for the Smith Act victims. I hope we
can get some contributions too.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” the organizer added, “but always remember that we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
must stress our united-front campaign. We’ve got to show the
workers in these right-wing [that is, anticommunist] unions
that the Party stands for peace, higher wages, and better
working conditions.</p>

<p>“What if most of the workers don’t agree with communism?”
the organizer continued. “That doesn’t keep them from working
with us. We’ve got to convince them that we must all
work together, that we have common aims. Besides, it will
help us organize the rank and file against the reactionary
[anticommunist] leadership.”</p>

<p>The caucuses give guidance. This is how to agitate on
Party issues: Issue petitions and resolutions, set up a “peace”
stand outside the shop gate, start a front. Ideas are exchanged,
weaknesses analyzed, tactical shifts worked out, all under
supervision of Party headquarters.</p>

<p>Sometimes the caucuses manipulate special “deals” to enhance
Party influence. The following case, which occurred in
Cleveland, Ohio, is revealing:</p>

<p>“Howard,” the organizer said, addressing one of the older
members, “you’ve got to give up your job as editor of the
union’s newspaper.”</p>

<p>“Give up ...,” the member said, surprised.</p>

<p>“Your time’s running out. You’re just about pegged as a
communist. If you try to stay on another year, you’ll be thrown
out. That’ll cause a rumpus and we’ll lose ground. Step out
now.”</p>

<p>“OK,” the member replied, accepting the instruction. “I
think I can get Elmer elected in my place. Dick may want it,
but we’ve got to stop him.”</p>

<p>“Right you are,” the organizer said. “Dick is a vicious Red
baiter. He’s a faker and reactionary. I’d rather have the paper
discontinued than have him as editor.”</p>

<p>“Elmer isn’t known as a communist,” the member added.
“Of course, if I support him it’ll tag him somewhat, but....”</p>

<p>“That’s our best approach, Howard,” the organizer said.
“Submit your resignation tomorrow. You’ll catch Dick and
his cronies off guard. Then push all you can for Elmer.”</p>

<p>What follows now is a case history which reveals the whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
sinister process of infiltration. It concerns an organization that
we shall call The 123 Group, typical of many trade-union,
fraternal, civic, community, and nationality groups. It covers
a six-year struggle for control between the Communist Party—working
through a group of open and concealed members,
sympathizers, and dupes—and a noncommunist opposition, at
first unorganized, hitting wildly, but later to become all-powerful.</p>

<p>The 123 Group was an influential and respected noncommunist
organization. Even partly to control its actions would
be of great value to the Party.</p>

<p>The problem for communist headquarters was how best to
attack. The obvious target, as in most organizations, was the
officers. To control one officer, such as a president, secretary,
or treasurer, is often worth ten, twenty, or fifty rank-and-file
members. Everything must be done to prepare for the next
elections in an effort to oust as many anticommunists as possible
and replace them with pro-Party people or at least neutrals.</p>

<p>All officers of The 123 Group were bitterly anticommunist
except one, the secretary. He would have loudly protested if
called a Party member, and he wasn’t; but for many years he
had maintained cordial contacts with Party officials. He was,
in every respect, a sympathizer. He was popular and had a
large personal following among the rank and file. For this
reason the anticommunists had not been able to defeat him.
Here was the obvious weak point.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to draw up an entire slate of candidates,” the
Party organizer emphasized. “Let’s call it the ‘Reform Ticket.’
We must include a few reactionaries. That’ll hide our interest.”
Then the frank admission: “We must not show our hand.
We’ll run on a program acceptable to the right wing as much
as possible. After we get in we’ll take control.”</p>

<p>The communist Trojan horse was jockeying for position.
Maneuver often compensates for lack of numbers and organizational
position. Deals, stratagems, and hypocrisy must be
given free play.</p>

<p>The secretary-sympathizer agreed to run on the Reform<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
Ticket. His name would lend prestige and give the ticket a
capable career officer. Here was the first breakthrough. More
deals, however, were necessary.</p>

<p>The chief problem now was the presidency. Whom to run?
A known procommunist could not win. To support another
anticommunist was unthinkable. The answer: an opportunist.</p>

<p>The right man was at hand, a noncommunist, personally
ambitious, who disliked the current president. Lacking a
dynamic personality, a “little backward,” as one Party official
called him, he could be “guided.” He was just the man to
head the ticket.</p>

<p>He was contacted. Run for president and you’ll receive
“our” support. The communists, of course, didn’t openly identify
themselves. The opportunist, however, probably suspected,
but he didn’t care. That is the mark of an opportunist:
his personal ambition is so great that it overrides every other
consideration.</p>

<p>Now the other noncommunist candidates on the Reform
Ticket must be chosen.</p>

<p>To communists there are different degrees of “foes.” A “60
per cent” foe is better “working material” than a “100 per
cent” foe. Another may be appraised as a 40 or even 10 percenter.
In drawing up the slate, find as many “low percenters”
as possible. Also there is the practical factor, always to be
remembered, of selecting candidates who can “pull” votes
to the ticket.</p>

<p>These deals were made.</p>

<p>Then there was the task, after selection of the slate (which
contained concealed communists along with noncommunists),
of getting it elected.</p>

<p>This meant more strategy, manipulation, and deals. The
communists could count on only a small minority of the vote—their
own members and a few sympathizers. Their tactic lay
in exploiting existing jealousies, conflicts, and dissatisfactions
among the majority noncommunists. To catch the secret of
communist infiltration tactics, we must understand how the
Party, with great skill, is able to exploit, guide, and capitalize
on the splits and lack of interest in noncommunist ranks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
That’s how the Party is able to wield an influence far out of
proportion to its numbers.</p>

<p>There was, of course, the usual share of communist deals.
One technique, often used, is a deal with a noncommunist
member of the group who is running for office in another
organization in which the communists also have members.
“Support our candidates here,” the deal goes, “and we’ll help
you next week.” Then there is the communist who is a union
official or company foreman who says to a noncommunist
member of the group, “Maybe we can consider a promotion
for you at the plant if....”</p>

<p>Another technique is to urge “benevolent neutrality” upon
those noncommunists who are wavering and might vote for
the current officers; that’s a good day for them to stay home
or go fishing!</p>

<p>Result: The Reform Ticket won a complete victory. Now
one-third of the officers, five Party members, were controlled
by Party headquarters. The rest were virtual prisoners.</p>

<p>To infiltrate an organization is only a first step. It must be
made to serve Party interests. There are many ways:</p>

<p class="tb">1. A proposal, promoted by the communists, was made that
Henry G., both a member of The 123 Group and a secret
communist, be sent as an official delegate to the National Convention
of a communist-front organization. This group was
painted in glowing terms as a fighter for human rights. No
mention was made of communist control. Opponents objected,
labeled it as a communist “outfit.” The vote was taken: motion
passed, and the communist member went, expenses paid.</p>

<p class="tb">2. A concealed communist was running for public office.
Motion was made that his candidacy be endorsed. Again another
outcry from the opponents, but the motion passed.</p>

<p class="tb">3. “John Doe is a victim of injustice. We should pass a
resolution to be sent to the governor demanding his freedom....”
An anticommunist protested, “It’s not our business to be
passing resolutions about such matters.” “A reactionary,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
replies the spokesman for the communist line. “Aren’t you
interested in justice?” Label your opponents as “Fascists,”
“reactionaries,” “hardhearted.” The vote was taken: motion
passed.</p>

<p class="tb">4. The communists had established a Party “front school.”
Money was needed for expansion. One source: The 123
Group. Motion was made that a contribution be sent to the
“school.” Passed. A tactic the communists like to use: Make
noncommunists “share” the Party’s expenses.</p>

<p class="tb">5. Other ways: seize, if possible, the group’s bulletin or
newspaper. Make it a Party mouthpiece, or at least attempt to
silence or weaken its criticism. The instructions flow steadily
from Party headquarters: start a letter-writing campaign, pass
this foreign-policy resolution, contact a public official. The
123 Group becomes a masquerade for communist attack.</p>

<p>In one instance an official of The 123 Group (who was also
a secret communist) was invited to testify before a congressional
investigating committee about a certain economic development.
What did he do? He went to the Party and asked
for copies of the <i>Daily Worker</i> and other communist background
material. Now he had the Party line!</p>

<p>Such victories are not always easily won. One requirement
is a well-planned floor strategy for all club meetings. That’s
the secret of many Party successes. First, as one Party leader
expressed it, “we want our mob present.” No absences are allowed.
Every Party vote is needed. If a motion is to be made,
who will present it? When? Early in the evening while the
crowd is large? Or much later when many of the delegates,
but not the communists, have gone home? How should objections
be handled? If concessions must be made, which ones?</p>

<p>Every move is planned.</p>

<p>If a communist is chairman, the task is easier. He can use
many parliamentary devices such as not recognizing an opposition
speaker, rushing votes, ruling opponents out of order.
The communists, one member remarked, always had the meetings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
“so well in hand” in his organization that an “outsider”
had no chance of even voicing opposition.</p>

<p>Numerous tricks can be used; for example the diamond
formation, seating members in a diamond pattern. This gives
the impression, during debate, that Party supporters are more
numerous than they actually are. Another is the false opposition.
Selected members make foolish, silly, and stupid objections
to communist proposals. The purpose: to make the
communists look even better.</p>

<p>Communist infighting is vicious and utterly devoid of moral
principle.</p>

<p>For several years the Party controlled The 123 Group.
Time after time, the organization consisting of hundreds of
members was subverted for Party purposes.</p>

<p>Then troubles began to appear. Some sympathizers and
opportunists grew restive. Noncommunist opposition increased.</p>

<p>Party counterattacks were launched.</p>

<p>The first problem was to hold the opportunist-president in
line. Vanity is a weapon in the early stages. Do everything
you can to “blow up” his ego. Raise his salary (the organization
pays for it, not the Party). Give him a testimonial dinner.
Send him as a delegate to a convention, preferably as far
away as possible. The communist vice-president will run
affairs until he returns.</p>

<p>Frequently, as time passes, opportunists and sympathizers
become “big-headed.” They don’t do what they are told.
“Jack J. is feeling the effects of power,” one Party leader complained.
“He’s forgetting his old factional allies.” Now stronger
measures must be applied. Remind him forcefully that it
is communist support which keeps him in office. “Encircle the
guy,” as one Party member recommended, meaning to make
him even more dependent on the Party. Perhaps cut his
salary. A little “smear” campaign might be effective.</p>

<p>If new alignments can be made, he might be dropped. If
not, he’ll be subjected to even stronger pressure. Blackmail
and threats are often part of communist tactics at this stage.</p>

<p>Finally, six years later, The 123 Group eliminated the communist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
infiltration after a long, tiring battle. Here were some
of the basic points the noncommunist opposition had to keep
everlastingly in mind:</p>

<p class="tb">1. <i>Rally the majority noncommunist strength.</i> The communists,
usually a minority, capitalize on the lack of interest of
noncommunists. One communist member was elected to office
with only 3 per cent of the total eligible vote.</p>

<p class="tb">2. <i>Remember that communism is always an evil, never a
temporary good.</i> Often communists give the impression of
working for the best interests of the group. “What do you care
whether we are communists?” one Party leader asked. “We’re
trying to help you.” Another quipped: “Politics don’t matter.
It’s the issues that count.” That’s wrong. Any conciliation,
friendship, or trust placed in communism will sooner or later
be exploited against democratic society.</p>

<p class="tb">3. <i>Don’t underestimate communist ability.</i> Many communists
are extremely intelligent. One Party leader was described
by an opponent as very capable, well versed in parliamentary
procedure, and possessing an excellent command of English.
To think of communists as mere rabble rousers and nuisances
is to risk defeat.</p>

<p class="tb">4. <i>Understand communist tactics.</i> Learn how they, though
numerically few, are able to exert a maximum influence. Deceit
is one of their strongest weapons.</p>

<p class="tb">5. <i>Stand up and be counted.</i> Many noncommunists hesitate
to speak up in meetings. They fear to be attacked by an acid-tongued
Party spokesman. They may remember Mr. So-and-So.
He opposed a communist proposal several weeks ago. Now
look at him. He hasn’t slept a full night for weeks. Somebody
is constantly calling him on the telephone. His relatives are
pestered. It’s best, they think, just to stay away from meetings
or, if there, remain silent. Others, irritated, bored, or simply
“fed up” with communist tactics, walk out. Just what the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
communists want. They have a clear field. Speak your mind.
Stand your ground. Don’t be afraid to defend American
liberty.</p>

<p class="tb">6. <i>Wage the fight in a democratic manner.</i> Emotion should
never replace reason as a weapon. To pursue extralegal methods
is simply to injure your cause. Fight hard, but fight according
to the rules.</p>

<p>When communists speak of their desire to advance the
cause of labor, the question should always be asked: What is
their objective? In August, 1957, streetcar and bus workers
went on strike in Lodz, Poland. The workers were using this
means to protest against the unfulfilled promises of the leaders
of the Polish Communist government. The strike was soon
brought to a halt through the use of some 3000 troops with
fixed bayonets and police who fired tear gas into the milling
mob.</p>

<p>While the communists were demonstrating their brutality
and terroristic tactics against labor in Poland, American communists
were giving another demonstration of how they
habitually ignore the truth. William Z. Foster, as the elder
statesman of the Communist Party in the United States, was
saying:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>One of the most striking phenomena of the capitalist world
in recent years has been the enormous extension of the workers’
fight for democracy—among other phases, to defend their
right to organize and strike.... World Socialism has enormously
stimulated this struggle.</p>

</div>

<p>The answer is a simple one. The communists, once in control,
crush every opponent, while, in coming to power, they
promise everything to soften the opposition. This opposition
will be “softened,” however, only if we allow infiltration to
take place before our very eyes without knowing it for what
it is.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_17">17.<br>
<i>The Communist Front</i></h3>

</div>

<p>The auditorium was packed. More than 1000 delegates and
observers waved their arms enthusiastically, along with some
200 others who did not fill out registration forms to avoid
leaving a record of their attendance. (The <i>Daily Worker</i> said
they were in “... fear of intimidation.”) This was the founding
convention of the National Negro Labor Council, a new
organization dedicated to “equality,” “social progress,” and
the upholding of “civil rights.” Speeches, resolutions, election
of officers, everything ran smoothly. Two days later came adjournment.
A new communist front had been born.</p>

<p>Delegates had come from all over the United States. They
would now return to their home cities, start local chapters,
enroll members, issue literature.</p>

<p>A master organizing hand was at work. One thousand individuals
just didn’t arrive by accident.</p>

<p>The convention call was communist-inspired. For weeks in
advance, local Party members had been arranging housing,
running errands, securing finances.</p>

<p>The Council claimed that its purpose was to aid the Negro;
however, the House Committee on Un-American Activities
concluded that, “rather than helping the Negro worker, it has
been a deterrent to him.”</p>

<p>The founding of the National Negro Labor Council was
typical of many Party fronts created over the past generation.</p>

<p>Fronts probably represent the Party’s most successful tactic
in capturing noncommunist support. Like mass agitation and
infiltration, fronts espouse the deceptive Party line (hence the
term “front”) while actually advancing the real Party line.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
In this way the Party is able to influence thousands of noncommunists,
collect large sums of money, and reach the
minds, pens, and tongues of many high-ranking and distinguished
individuals. Moreover, fronts are excellent fields for
Party recruitment.</p>

<p>A front is an organization which the communists openly or
secretly control. The communists realize that they are not welcome
in American society. Party influence, therefore, is transmitted,
time after time, by a belt of concealed members, sympathizers,
and dupes. Fronts become transmission belts between
the Party and the noncommunist world. Earl Browder,
when head of the Party, gave this definition: “Transmission
belts mean having Communists work among the masses in the
various organizations.”</p>

<p>Some may be newly created, or, as often happens, they may
be old-line organizations captured by infiltration, like The 123
Group mentioned in the preceding chapter. They may operate
nationally, regionally, or locally. Some are permanent
organizations; others exist for only a day, a week, or a month.</p>

<p>The Party has operated hundreds of major fronts in practically
every field of Party agitation: “peace,” civil rights, protection
of the foreign-born, support for Smith Act “victims,”
abolition of H-bomb tests, exploitation of nationality and
minority groups. Some are based on specific appeal, to teachers,
writers, lawyers, labor, women, youth. Many have national
officers, local chapters, and substantial assets.</p>

<p>In addition, literally hundreds of minor fronts of all shapes,
sizes, and types appear each year in everyday Party life. They
serve a specific short-time purpose, then disappear. A few
handbills, a rally, or a picket line, and a front has gone to
work.</p>

<p>We must not think of fronts in terms of legitimate organizations.
A few fronts collect dues, issue a newspaper, or sponsor
organized activities, such as a sports program or cultural affairs.
Most, however, exist only on paper. Their assets usually
consist of a few office supplies, a secondhand Mimeograph
machine, and a mailing list. The danger of a Party front rests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
not on its physical appearance or size but on its ability to
deceive.</p>

<p>A few fronts may maintain separate headquarters, usually
in a small room in an old building. Some operate from Party
headquarters, a basement, or somebody’s home. Often they
are found in clusters, one office serving as the headquarters
for two, three, or a half-dozen fronts. The only difference is the
wording of their names.</p>

<p>“Front schools,” where Marxist and related subjects were
available for noncommunist students, have been most important
to the communists over the years. In one such school it
is estimated that over 100,000 individuals received instruction;
in another, 75,000.</p>

<p>Every front, in its own way, is fighting the Party’s battles:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—sponsoring agitation campaigns;</p>

<p class="hanging">—collecting money (fronts are one of the Party’s chief sources of
income);</p>

<p class="hanging">—supplying speakers for noncommunist organizations (it’s surprising
the number of requests received by front groups,
especially those sponsoring “peace” and “civil rights,” for
speakers. A sympathizer or dupe who has prominence in the
community, such as a lawyer or professor, will often be sent);</p>

<p class="hanging">—issuing literature;</p>

<p class="hanging">—sponsoring mass rallies;</p>

<p class="hanging">—lobbying for or against legislative bills;</p>

<p class="hanging">—influencing key individuals whom the Party could not otherwise
reach;</p>

<p class="hanging">—teaching Marxist doctrines.</p>

</div>

<p>During the recent period when most Party headquarters
were closed because of a tactical shift to underground operations,
fronts performed many functions for the Party. In
Chapter 20, we shall see this aspect of fronts.</p>

<p>A single front can generate terrific communist pressure.
Take this case, for example:</p>

<p class="tb">Time: shortly after lunch. Agnes G, executive secretary of
the DEF Committee to Fight the High Cost of Living, is
reading a letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>Dan H enters the office. “It’s happened. The legislature just
passed the Anticommunist Bill.”</p>

<p>This bill must be stopped.</p>

<p>As a first step Agnes dictates a letter to Professor Frank Y,
a “good friend” at the university. “Issue a statement right
away. This bill threatens freedom of speech. It must be
vetoed.”</p>

<p>Then more letters are sent to teachers, clergymen, several
lawyers. Contact is made with key Party members and sympathizers.</p>

<p>“The Anticommunist Bill has passed. Send telegrams to the
governor, urging a veto. Start a petition circulating.”</p>

<p>Next, a bold step: Agnes places a telephone call to the
governor.</p>

<p>“Mr. Governor, I’m speaking for the DEF Committee to
Fight the High Cost of Living. We are disturbed about the
passage of the Anticommunist Bill. We feel you should veto it.
Would it be possible to have our representatives meet with
you?”</p>

<p>The governor agrees. He wants to hear all points of view.
The DEF Committee sounds like one of many groups interested
in this legislation.</p>

<p>An appointment is made.</p>

<p>Pressure was being built up. The front could enter where
the Party never dreamed of going. Three ministers, an attorney,
and a newspaperman were contacted. Would they see
the governor as part of the delegation?</p>

<p>“I want Larry R to go along,” Agnes says. “He’s not too
bright a guy, but he’s easy and willing. I can tell him what to
say. Besides, he’s from a very respectable organization.”</p>

<p>Nothing was said about the fact that this delegation was
serving a communist purpose.</p>

<p>Every point had to be planned. “Be sure the right people
do the talking.” About one fellow the Party organizer had
commented, “Better have him stay quiet.” You never know,
maybe a dupe will say something out of place.</p>

<p>How to talk to the governor? The delegation could act like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
“nice, little people,” but that wouldn’t be very impressive. Or
it could be vaguely threatening. The latter suggestion was
ruled out as too dangerous.</p>

<p>Not everything went according to plan. One minister refused
to go. Agnes became angry. “It takes this kind of work,”
she fumed, “to see what ministers are made of—dishwater.”</p>

<p>A wonderful guy, if you cooperate; if not, you’re a “bum.”</p>

<p>The delegation was dispatched, a delegation made up
chiefly of noncommunists, yet fighting for communist aims, a
delegation organized exclusively by a communist front. The
DEF Committee was not interested in opposing the high cost
of living. <i>It was fighting for communism.</i></p>

<p>Fronts exist not in isolation but as part of a vast, interlaced
front system. Communist pressure can be greatly increased by
manipulating these organizations.</p>

<p>Take, for example, roof, or compound, fronts. Here a number
of fronts, as in the nationality field, will form a super,
over-all front such as the old American League Against War
and Fascism, which at its peak claimed 7,500,000 members.
Often the propaganda value is to show unity: all these organizations,
representing many different nationalities, are working
together for common aims.</p>

<p>Or consider the National Negro Labor Council, mentioned
at the beginning of this chapter. This also was a roof, or compound,
front created by already existing fronts. Let’s see how
this works.</p>

<p>First, “delegates” must be “elected” to a “national founding
convention.” Immediately, communist fronts across the
nation “elect delegates,” and communist-controlled labor
unions choose as their delegates those best suited for convention
service.</p>

<p>At the convention all arrangements are made by Party leaders,
including the selection of officers, the issuing of press releases,
the passing of resolutions. This includes the actual
running of the convention to ensure security. To illustrate, a
newspaper reporter went to the convention. He had once been
a Party member but had been expelled. On the first day of the
convention one of the officials invited him outside and asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
if he had been expelled. The reporter admitted that he had,
and was ordered not to come back into the convention hall.</p>

<p>Hailed as representing “thousands of members,” the new
organization is a front created out of fronts.</p>

<p>Another technique of manipulation is the continuing front.
Here the same front is maintained by changing the name to
meet current conditions. In 1940 the American Peace Mobilization
was formed, urging mobilization for peace and no aid
to Britain. In 1941, after Germany’s invasion of Russia, the
name was changed to American People’s Mobilization, and the
demands to all-out aid to Britain and a second front. This was
the same group with a different name.</p>

<p>Again, on October 16, 1943, the Young Communist League
was dissolved and the very next day the American Youth for
Democracy was formed. Later the group was called Labor
Youth League. All were designed to recruit young people for
communism.</p>

<p>The continuing front is well suited for “victim” agitation
cases; for example, the Committee to Save John Doe. This
group, so active for Doe, had lapsed into disuse. A new “victim,”
Richard Roe, was now at hand. Resurrect the old front!</p>

<p>That is exactly what happened. A communist arrived in
town and contacted leaders of the old Committee to Save the
Martinsville Seven. Where had it achieved the best results
while agitating for the Seven? What were the problems? How
could it best be used again?</p>

<p>A few days later the new front was already in action; the
Committee to Save Albert Jackson, the same old faces under
a new name. On Sunday morning its members were handing
out leaflets in front of churches. In this instance Jackson was
executed and the comrades turned to other fields.</p>

<p>Still another device is the satellite front, a cluster of minor
fronts around a larger front. A new issue, like higher transit
rates or the draining of a swamp, arises. The DEF Committee
to Fight the High Cost of Living (the larger front) starts
satellites, such as related committees in various sections of the
city. Many of these satellites are paper organizations; however,
they make a formidable showing to the uninformed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>These fronts are a vehicle for communist pressure. They are
highly fissionable. From many comes one; from one come
many. They can be cut, sliced, slivered, or compounded to fit
any need. No wonder the Party makes so much use of them in
mass agitation.</p>

<p>The campaign is launched, urging the veto of the Anticommunist
Bill. Let’s see how the Party’s front system is brought
into play.</p>

<p>Suddenly telegrams, letters, petitions pour in on the governor
from all kinds of groups such as organizations protesting
higher taxes; youth, women’s, union, and veterans’ organizations;
free-speech groups; civil-rights organizations. To an uncritical
eye it must seem that a wide stratum of population is
interested in a veto of the anticommunist legislation. Then
messages arrive from other countries (from international
fronts), as if the whole world, “millions of people” as the communists
like to say, is vitally interested in the bill.</p>

<p>Many noncommunists may oppose the legislation for a variety
of reasons and express their opinions by letter, telegram,
and petition. That, very emphatically, does not make them
communists. They are only exercising their democratic privileges.
What we are interested in here, however, is how the
Communist Party, through its front system, can stimulate a
vast and often effective propaganda barrage—a barrage which,
within hours, can be turned off or shifted elsewhere.</p>

<p>Many times fronts appear bewildering in their variety;
agitating on countless issues; based on different groups and
occupations; and working in many ways. But actually their
technique of formation is virtually identical.</p>

<p>Let’s look briefly inside a communist front and see how it
operates. At the center is always the Party, organizing, manipulating,
seeing that the right persons are in charge. Noncommunists
might well ponder this comment by a Party organizer:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Experience has shown that most sponsors are unwilling to give
of themselves sufficiently to stop the secretary from directing
policy.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">So true! The communists realize that if the secretary (or other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
key officer) is a communist (almost always a concealed member),
the Party can dominate the organization. Let the letterhead
glitter with noncommunist names: president, vice-president,
members of the executive board. They serve as lightning
rods, camouflaging the communist interest. To the sponsors,
the prestige; to the communists, the power.</p>

<p>Around this communist core come layer after layer of noncommunists.
As we have seen in Chapter 15, great emphasis
is placed on attracting noncommunists, the more prominent
the better, into communist propaganda work. These noncommunists,
by allowing their names to be used as sponsors, giving
testimonials, or appearing at front rallies, are aiding the
Party. It cannot be emphasized too often how the communists
attempt to exploit for strictly partisan purposes the legitimate
interests of noncommunists in social and economic problems,
world peace, civil rights, and so forth.</p>

<p>Most important to fronts are mailing lists containing the
names of persons to whom literature can be sent. Perhaps you
have received such propaganda in the mail and wondered
whence it came. Party-front mailing lists are compiled in many
ways—from telephone books, directories, membership rolls of
infiltrated organizations (“loaned” by concealed members).
Then the daily press is followed. Front headquarters may jot
down the names of officers in noncommunist organizations.
You never know. Someday they might “come in handy.”</p>

<p>Party fronts are aggressive. To wait for the noncommunist
is wrong. Seek him out. “We must get into the neighborhoods
more and into the home.” Through rallies, parades, picket
lines, forums, debates, circulation of literature, fronts are constantly
seeking public support. They operate on the main
streets of America.</p>

<p>Another thing: The agitation is always practical. Talk about
peace, jobs, and the price of milk, not Marx’s ideas of revolution.
Link the struggle with “the fight for pork chops.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Peace is an everyday issue and ... should involve the housewife,
the woman who has to wrestle with budgets in the hopeless
struggle with taxes, high prices and a shrinking pay check.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>In one instance, for example, a cookbook was issued by a
front, a “dollar stretcher” containing low-priced menus. Here
is the point. These recipes will help, somewhat. But, Mrs.
Housewife, you can never hope for a stable economy (where
prices are always low) until “peace” (Soviet style) is achieved.</p>

<p>That’s mixing propaganda with eggs and butter, sugar and
salt.</p>

<p>Many times, trick “come-ons” are used. Consider communist-sponsored
forums, for instance. Here are some Party-suggested
topics:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—Are American marriages a failure?</p>

<p class="hanging">—How to find an apartment.</p>

<p class="hanging">—Should the voting age be reduced to eighteen years?</p>

<p class="hanging">—Future of youth, what is it?</p>

<p class="hanging">—Can heart disease be cured?</p>

<p class="hanging">—Can cancer be cured or prevented?</p>

<p class="hanging">—How to become a cultured person.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">What have these to do with communism? Nothing. But they
bring listeners within talking distance.</p>

<p>If one thing won’t work, maybe another will, such as a special
celebration, in which a front sponsors an exhibit of “peace”
literature or Russian photographs. Then there are round-robin
letters, chain telephone calls, forums for high school science
teachers. One front sold “Christmas seals.” Another was planning
to put out a leaflet. “Fine,” commented an associate, “but
be sure to add the inscription which appears on the Statue of
Liberty. That’ll make it sound better.” Festivals and rallies,
often featuring foreign “dignitaries,” attract hundreds, even
thousands. Don’t forget to conduct polls on the street, always
securing through partisan manipulation “proof” that the “people”
support points advocated in the Party line.</p>

<p>Communist Parties around the world collaborate whenever
it will advance their cause. Some years ago a women’s conference
was convened in Paris, France, and out of it grew the
Women’s International Democratic Federation.</p>

<p>Long before the Paris gathering the Communist Party went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
to work promoting delegations of American women. One hundred
telegrams were sent out from Communist Party headquarters
in New York City to leaders of various women’s
organizations, announcing that they had been chosen as delegates
and inviting them to attend a meeting at the home of
the chairman of the committee. A temporary Committee on
Cooperation with the International Women’s Conference came
into being to make arrangements. An expediter was appointed
to get passports, and a special rate of 495 dollars for a round
trip by plane was secured. And so the ladies went to Paris,
many without the slightest idea that the affair had been promoted
by the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Out of the Women’s International Democratic Federation
grew its American affiliate, the Congress of American Women.
Shortly after the Congress had its first meeting, the National
Committee of the Communist Party met in New York City. At
this meeting one of its members discussed the importance of
the Women’s International Democratic Federation to the
Communist Party. This high Party official then stated that the
Party did not then control the newly created Congress of
American Women, and that the communists needed to “infiltrate
it more.” The Congress has since been designated as a
subversive organization by the Attorney General, the Senate
Internal Security Subcommittee, and the House Committee on
Un-American Activities.</p>

<p>Earlier in this chapter we spoke of international fronts. The
following is an example:</p>

<p>An envelope was postmarked at Prague, Czechoslovakia,
addressed to an American college. Inside was a printed letter
signed by the Prorector and Secretary of Charles University,
Prague, formerly renowned as a great European educational
institution, now a communist propaganda front. The letter
opened:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">We send you the Proclamation of the Charles University
against the use [by the United States] of the bacteriological
warfare in Korea and urge you to express your views on the
named Proclamation.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>Enclosed was the “<span class="allsmcap">PROCLAMATION</span> of the Academic Community
of the Charles University....”</p>

<p>As you read the message, note the propaganda techniques
employed:</p>

<p class="tb">1. <i>The appeal prostitutes the reputation of a well-known
university for propaganda purposes</i>: “We, professors, lecturers
and the other scientific workers of the Charles University in
Prague, one of the oldest universities of the world....”</p>

<p class="tb">2. <i>The appeal allegedly is based on humanitarian and scientific
grounds</i>: “With full responsibility to our human and
scientific consciences we have considered the danger which
threatens all of humanity through the crimes that are being
committed by the American imperialist army.”</p>

<p class="tb">3. <i>The appeal is directed to scientific teachers in universities.</i>
The idea is that an appeal from a member of one profession
or occupation to another is more effective than random
appeals. This device is often used, with Russian writers,
artists, musicians addressing their “counterparts” in America:
“We address ourselves to you, scientific workers of universities
of all countries....”</p>

<p class="tb">4. <i>The weight of scholarly backing is designed to influence
opinion.</i> (If scientists in this university say the charges are
true, they must be true.) For example:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">These facts prove that the armies of the American interventionists
have repeatedly used bacteriological weapons.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">From the American airplanes bombs were dropped containing
different kind of insects, rats, etc., which were infected with
plague, cholera and other epidemic diseases, and infected
foodstuffs as well.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">... we are ashamed to think of those American members of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
medical science who have committed themselves to the preparation
of these repulsive crimes.</p>

</div>

<p class="tb">5. <i>Action is recommended</i>: “We urge you to refuse to place
your scientific knowledge at the service of mass extermination
of mankind.... Protest not only in your activity as teachers
and in your work in the scientific press, but with your governments
as well!”</p>

<p>The proclamation is designed to make a lie believable, to
paint the United States as a murderer and the Soviet Union
as a protector of peace, thanks to a dignified and “respectable”
front.</p>

<p>Most of this communist propaganda would be laughable
except for its deadly seriousness. The Party is not kidding.
This is live ammunition designed to capture, maim, and kill.
To regard communist fronts and their propaganda as foolishness
is to risk our freedom.</p>

<p>Examine the communist attitude toward parades, for example.
Most people think of parades as a time of interest and
commemoration. Not the communists. Parades are weapons of
propaganda, another form of front.</p>

<p>Listen to these Party instructions, for example, concerning
parades, issued by the old Central Committee of the Party before
it was abolished:</p>

<p>The marchers must be well mannered. Walk in rhythm.
Don’t be “a line of stragglers shuffling along like a tired and
discouraged army in retreat.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The result is that the value of the demonstration as a means of
impressing and winning over or neutralizing hostile people
along the line of march is lost.</p>

</div>

<p>Here are a few things that should be remembered:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Every two or three hundred marchers should be led by a
band, a bugle or fife and drum corps. We need scores of
bands, with plenty of brass instruments.</p>

</div>

<p>Banners and placards! Do not be “stingy with the length of
sticks.” Cut out the fancy lettering. It is difficult to read.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>Use good English. “Some slogans are so bad grammatically,
that people are amused at seeing them.” The fewer the words
the better. Don’t just “slap” slogans on cardboard. Make sure
they are “politically correct.”</p>

<p>More advice: carry placards “on a slight angle, with wording
facing the sidewalks.” Scatter them through the parade;
avoid bunching. Streamers: too much pulling causes ripping;
not enough causes folding.</p>

<p>A favorite field for communist fronts is the election campaign
for public office. Running communist candidates for
city council, mayor, governor, even for the presidency of the
United States, is an old Party habit. Never has the Party, running
under its own name, been able to secure many votes. In
instances where Party candidates have run under their own
colors, their defeats have almost invariably been disastrous.
Party candidates have run five times (1924 through 1940) for
the presidency of the United States and in 1932 achieved
their highest percentage of the total vote cast—a mere 0.3 per
cent, or 102,991 out of almost 40,000,000 votes cast. Three
times the percentage was 0.1, and once, 0.2. In instances,
however, where the Party has maneuvered political alliances,
it has achieved more success, as shown by the election of Benjamin
J. Davis, Jr., and Peter Cacchione, both well-known
communists, to the City Council of New York City in the
1940’s. Yet these campaigns give training in agitation and enable
the Party to smear rivals, scream its propaganda, and
cause unrest.</p>

<p>Party candidates also frequently run in concealed capacities.
Board-of-education campaigns are well suited to communist
exploitation. Usually running as independents, Party
candidates can conceal their true affiliations. Moreover, national
and international issues that would betray their basic
sentiments, such as the Russian intervention in Hungary, are
not likely to arise. In such campaigns Party-sponsored candidates
are invited to parent-teacher meetings, community
centers, public forums, to participate in radio debates (when
the time is donated), and speak in the homes of private citizens.
“The Citizens (or Independent) Committee for ——”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
takes the candidate where, as a communist, he could never
dream of going. The Party, behind the scenes, works overtime
stuffing propaganda into envelopes, passing out cards, drumming
up enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The results are often amazing. William Z. Foster in one of
his books boasts that in Cleveland, Ohio, “A. Krchmarek,
Communist candidate for the school board, received 64,213
votes,” while in California, “the well-known Communist, Bernadette
Doyle, polled the big total of 613,670 votes on a nonpartisan
ticket as candidate for Superintendent of Public
Schools.” Krchmarek and Doyle both ran on independent,
nonpartisan tickets and were not identified on the ballot as
communists. In another instance a Party member, also running
in a concealed capacity, failed by only a few votes to be
elected a city official. He was supported by two anticommunist
newspapers that had no way of knowing his Party background.</p>

<p>This is the communist-front movement. Its strength rests on
deceit and its ability to attract the support of noncommunists.</p>

<p>Fronts, however, can be detected. You, as an alert citizen,
can do much to weaken their influence. Here are a few tests:</p>

<p class="tb">1. Does the organization espouse the cause of Soviet Russia?
Does it shift when the Party line shifts?</p>

<p>2. Does the organization feature as speakers at its meetings
known communists or sympathizers?</p>

<p>3. Does the organization sponsor causes, campaigns, literature,
petitions, or other activities sponsored by the Party or
other front organizations?</p>

<p>4. Is the organization used as a sounding board by, or is it
endorsed by, communist-controlled labor unions?</p>

<p>5. Does its literature follow the communist line or is it
printed by the communist press?</p>

<p>6. Does the organization receive consistent favorable mention
in communist publications?</p>

<p>7. Does the organization represent itself to be nonpartisan,
yet engage in political activities and consistently advocate
causes favored by the communists? Does it denounce both
fascists and communists?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>8. Does the organization denounce American foreign policy
while always lauding Soviet policy?</p>

<p>9. Does the organization utilize communist double talk by
referring to Soviet-dominated countries as democracies, complaining
that the United States is imperialistic, and constantly
denouncing monopoly-capital?</p>

<p>10. Have outstanding leaders in public life openly renounced
affiliation with the organization?</p>

<p>11. Does the organization, if espousing liberal, progressive
causes, attract well-known, honest, patriotic liberals, or does it
denounce well-known liberals?</p>

<p>12. Does the organization consistently consider matters not
directly related to its avowed purposes and objectives?</p>

<p class="tb">These are some ways, direct and indirect, of the above-ground
Communist Party, which is working against all of us.
But this is only one arm of a gigantic pincer. The other is
underground.</p>

<div class="chapter box2b">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_18">18.<br>
<i>Communism and Minorities</i></h3>

</div>

<p>The Communist Party from its very inception has held itself
out as the “vanguard of the working class,” and as such has
sought to assume the role of protector and champion of minorities.
It directs special attention, among others, to Negroes and
nationality groups. Actually the vast majority of Negroes and
members of foreign-language groups have rejected communism
for what it is: a heartless, totalitarian way of life which
completely disregards the dignity of man.</p>

<p>In the case of the Negro minority the Comintern began in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
1928 to lay down a specific Party line for the guidance of
comrades in the United States. According to Comintern instructions,
Negroes were to be considered as an “oppressed
race.” The Party was told to carry on a struggle “for equal
rights,” but “in the South ... the main Communist slogan
must be: <i>The Right of Self-Determination of the Negroes in
the Black Belt</i>.”</p>

<p>Communist leaders, faithfully following Moscow’s instructions,
promptly started a campaign of agitation. In nominating
James W. Ford, a Negro, to run for Vice-President of the
United States on the Communist Party ticket in 1932, with
presidential candidate William Z. Foster, C. A. Hathaway,
then a member of the Party’s Election Campaign National
Committee, reiterated instructions received in a 1930 Comintern
resolution:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In the first place, our demand is that the land of the Southern
white landlords ... be confiscated and turned over to the
Negroes....</p>

<p>Secondly, we propose to break up the present artificial state
boundaries ... and to establish the state unity of the territory
known as the “Black Belt,” where the Negroes constitute the
overwhelming majority of the population.</p>

<p>Thirdly, in this territory, we demand that the Negroes be
given the complete right of self-determination; <i>the right to set
up their own government</i> in this territory and the right to
separate, if <i>they</i> wish, from the United States.</p>

</div>

<p>Hence, “equal rights” and “self-determination” in the Black
Belt became the Party’s chief slogans for Negroes. By “self-determination”
the Party meant what Stalin had said: “... the
right of the oppressed peoples of the dependent countries and
colonies to complete secession, as the right of nations to independent
existence as states.”</p>

<p>As for the “Black Belt,” or as one article termed it, the “new
Negro Republic,” the communists have given various descriptions.
In 1948 they described the Belt as extending through
twelve Southern states: “Heading down from its eastern point
in Virginia’s tidewater section, it cuts a strip through North<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
Carolina, embraces nearly all of South Carolina, cuts into
Florida, passes through lower and central Georgia and Alabama,
engulfs Mississippi and the Louisiana Delta, wedges
into eastern Texas and Southwest Tennessee, and has its western
anchor in southern Arkansas.”</p>

<p>By 1952 the communist concept of the Black Belt had been
narrowed to “at least five Southeastern states, with port outlets
at Charleston on the Atlantic and Mobile on the Gulf, encompassing
the bulk of Mississippi, and a good section of
South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama.”</p>

<p>As we know from cumulative evidence, the Party’s position
toward Negroes is determined not by concern for their welfare
but obedience to Soviet foreign policy. As World War II approached,
for example, the Party switched its tactics regarding
“self-determination” in the Black Belt. Instead of calling for
the immediate and revolutionary overthrow of white landlords,
as the Comintern had originally instructed, the Party
now switched these demands to a purely theoretical and
propaganda level: “... It is clear that the Negro masses are
not yet ready to carry through the revolution which would
make possible the right to self-determination.” Why the shift?
To satisfy the Party’s united-front program, which demanded
that the Party work harmoniously with other groups to
strengthen the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The World War II period found the Party cynically abandoning
any alleged struggle for Negro rights. The aim was to
help not Negroes but Moscow. “When we fought for the right
of Negro workers to enter industries we often fought for such
jobs mainly in the interest of the war effort.” Earl Browder in
1945 admitted that as early as 1942 the Party had adopted
the theory that “... the struggle for Negro rights must be
postponed until after the war....” The Negro, in communist
eyes, was a mere pawn, to be manipulated for the attainment
of Party aims.</p>

<p>It became obvious that the Party, despite great efforts, had
failed to win over even a significant minority of Negroes.
Negroes resented the Party’s severe criticism of Negro clergymen
who had been vigorously denouncing communism. Earlier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
the Party had been unable adequately to justify Russia’s aid
to Italy in its invasion of Ethiopia. American Negroes had
realized that the Party was a fraud and a deception and that
it was willing to betray the Negro to better serve Soviet
Russia.</p>

<p>In early 1956 the Party decided to modify its advocacy of
“self-determination,” realizing that Negro opposition to communism
was growing. In making this change, communists said
they would still consider the Negroes as constituting a national
as well as a racial minority.</p>

<p>Eugene Dennis, resuming his old post as General Secretary
of the Communist Party (in 1956) after serving a prison term
for violation of the Smith Act, said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">In re-appraising our position on self-determination in the Black
Belt, our Party should emphasize, as never before, that the
struggle for Negro rights and freedom, north and south of the
Mason-Dixon line, has emerged as a general, national democratic
task, upon the solution of which depends the democratic
and social advance of the whole nation, particularly of the
workers and farmers.</p>

</div>

<p>The Party’s claim that it is working for Negro rights is a
deception and a fraud. The Party’s sole interest, as most American
Negroes know, is to hoodwink the Negro, to exploit him
and use him as a tool to build a communist America.</p>

<p>The Party has made vigorous efforts to infiltrate the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP). This organization in 1950 authorized its board of
directors to revoke the charter of any chapter found to be
communist-controlled. Nevertheless the Party has tried various
infiltration tactics:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—In Philadelphia, the Party secured NAACP applications and
instructed Party members to join.</p>

<p class="hanging">—In Louisiana, the Party’s District Organizer instructed all
Negro Party members to join the NAACP and urge the creation
of a youth organization, and to form committees to encourage
Negroes to register to vote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p class="hanging">—In Gary, Indiana, a Party member, also an NAACP member,
promoted the signing of petitions to pass a city ordinance.</p>

<p class="hanging">—In Cincinnati, a Party Organizer instructed that Party members
call the NAACP and urge the holding of a city-wide
mass meeting. When calling, they should claim to be members
of the NAACP.</p>

</div>

<p>The NAACP’s national leadership has vigorously denounced
communist attempts at infiltration. In 1956, when the NAACP
and other organizations sponsored a National Conference on
Civil Rights in Washington, the Party attempted to “move in,”
and started promoting the conference. The NAACP countered
by screening the delegates.</p>

<p>Similarly, in 1957, in the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom in
Washington, the Party again attempted to move in and tried
to exploit the pilgrimage as a rallying point for unity. NAACP
leaders publicly told the communists that they were not welcome,
and steps were taken to keep them off the platform.
One outstanding Negro leader even tried to cancel the pilgrimage
to prevent communists from propagandizing the
event. Concerning Paul Robeson, who has long fronted for the
communists, he stated: “... the boat is waiting to take him to
Russia....” He added that he would raise the necessary funds
to defray expenses. In Philadelphia, a Negro clergyman told
the Baptist Ministers Conference that the Negro people did
not want the communists interfering with their problems.</p>

<p>One of the most effective anticommunist measures I have
heard of is the following: The NAACP had a meeting in Norfolk,
Virginia, presided over by a clergyman. The minister
opened the meeting with the simple statement that if any
members of the Communist Party were present they would be
excused. Silence ensued, with no person leaving. Then the
chairman, starting with the front row, asked each individual if
he were a communist. All entered denials until he got to the
back of the room, where the state organizer for the Communist
Party was sitting with a white woman. When asked the
question, he tried to evade, but the minister pinned him
down. The state organizer then stated that he did not think it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
was proper to ask such a question. The minister calmly replied,
“You are excused,” and the couple left.</p>

<p>The Communist Party has stated: “The Negro race must
understand that capitalism means racial oppression and Communism
means social and racial equality.” Many Negroes,
however, have learned by bitter experience how fraudulent
and deceitful communists are. For example, Richard Wright,
the Negro novelist, tells in the book, <i>The God That Failed</i>,
why he rebelled against communist thought control. In describing
how at the time he left the Party he was assaulted on
a Chicago street, he wrote, “I could not quite believe what had
happened, even though my hands were smarting and bleeding.
I had suffered a public, physical assault by two white
Communists with black Communists looking on.”</p>

<p>In Buffalo, New York, at a Party meeting, a Negro comrade
stated that many Negroes felt they were joining a union when
they were recruited into the Party. The comrade, however,
was stopped at this point and not permitted to speak further.
In many cases Negroes have been recruited by deceptive
methods with the hope that once in the Party they would be
converted to communism. In one New York State club the
functionary learned that thirty members thought they were
joining a union rather than the Communist Party. The matter
was investigated, and it turned out that a Negro woman had
become overly enthusiastic in a membership drive. She had
not fully explained the nature of the organization being joined.</p>

<p>In San Francisco, Party functionaries were concerned about
a club where Negro members predominated, although the club
was actually controlled by white members. It was ordered that
the role of the white members be decreased. The functionaries
also instructed that the club be carefully watched to prevent
scandals, and warned that, while scandals must be prevented,
care should be exercised not to convey the impression that
white girls should not mix socially with Negroes or vice versa.
Some of the Negro wives were becoming suspicious, as it
seemed they were being pushed into the background after
their husbands joined the Party.</p>

<p>The Communist Party, while preaching “equality,” still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
differentiates between races. For example, in the 1957 convention
of the Party, an accurate record of the delegates was kept.
The breakdown was as follows: 209 males, 78 females; 54
Negroes, 2 Mexicans, and 1 Puerto Rican. The hypocrisy of
the Party was clearly shown when it required each delegate
to register his race, although for years the Party publicly has
campaigned to have the blank for “race” removed from all
questionnaires.</p>

<p>Communist leaders have been complaining bitterly about
the turnover of Negro members and of the Party’s inability to
indoctrinate any large number of Negroes. Information we
have received follows a regular pattern: Negroes are rejecting
communism.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A Negro in the Midwest became interested in the Party because
it claimed that Negroes were treated as equals. Later he
was unjustly accused of consorting with a white non-Party
member. He quit.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>A Negro in Illinois started going to Party social functions
and became impressed with communist talk of “equality.” But
when he attended more advanced meetings and heard the
United States constantly denounced, he came to the conclusion
that the communists were under the domination of Russia. He
left the Party.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>A Negro woman, recruited in Chicago, was rapidly promoted
by the Party. Then she noticed an incident involving a
Negro man who got into difficulties on his job, but the Party
refused to support him. She concluded that the Party was interested
in neither trade unionism nor the welfare of Negroes.
She quit.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>A Negro in New York joined the Party because he felt it was
championing his race. After a period of Marxist instruction, he
was told to secure a job with a work gang at a pier and to recruit
other Negroes into the Party. He came to the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
that the Party was not interested in him as a Negro but only as
a tool to recruit other Negroes. He quit.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>A New England Negro also became interested in the Party
when he learned of its alleged interest in helping his race. But
upon becoming a member he discovered that the Party’s interest
was strictly vocal, and nothing concrete was done to help
Negroes. Moreover, he disliked the Party’s denunciation of
God and religion. He quit.</p>

</div>

<p>As early as 1922 the Comintern approved a subsidy of
300,000 dollars for propaganda among American Negroes. In
1925 the Soviets requested that a group of Negroes be selected
to come to Russia for training in propaganda work. A dozen
were recruited. One of these, returning to the United States
three years later, brought with him a draft for 75,000 dollars
to help pay for propaganda work among his race.</p>

<p>One Negro later was designated to attend the Lenin School,
and his experience there further unmasked communist hypocrisy
and the Party’s true feelings toward the Negro. He
went to Russia with a delegation of students to enter the Lenin
School. This young Negro, as he has since related, then “believed
that through Communism a better and fairer world
could be developed for all mankind.”</p>

<p>He was troubled, however, by the communist position in
urging Negro “self-determination” and the implications of a
“buffer” state in this country being carved out of the so-called
“Black Belt.” Almost immediately after his arrival in Russia he
“was told long stories of political persecution” by the Negroes
attending the Lenin School. He was slow to give credence to
these stories until he saw for himself: “I found that Negroes
were special objects of political exploitation. The sacrifices and
dirty work planned for the American Negro Communists as
spearheads for communizing the United States made it obvious
that we were considered only as pawns in a game where
others would get the prize.”</p>

<p>Becoming more outspoken and cynical about the communist
program for Negroes, he became the target of a slander campaign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
inside the Lenin School. Finally this young American
Negro was charged and tried before a court-martial. He was
guilty of disaffection. A few students, sympathizing with his
position, made a bold decision to report their grievances to the
Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Then things began to
happen. Classes in the American Section of the school were
suspended. Some of the instructors were disciplined.</p>

<p>The young Negro explained that the Comintern ordered
Earl Browder, then Secretary of the Communist Party in the
United States, to Moscow immediately. Browder arrived and
sought to smooth things over. Eventually the young Negro
returned to the United States, working for a while as a Party
functionary in Detroit. One of his last jobs was to make preparations
for the founding of the National Negro Congress. Then
he quit because he could no longer give aid to the communists
“concentrating on their most helpless, and whom they think
to be, their most gullible victims: the Negro.”</p>

<p>The communists have created numerous fronts over the
years in attempts to attract Negroes. Once a front is discredited,
it is allowed to die and a new one created.</p>

<p>The American Negro Labor Congress came into being in
1925, and in 1930 its name was changed to the League of
Struggle for Negro Rights. Within six years it had ceased to
exist.</p>

<p>In 1935 the National Negro Congress was launched in
Washington, D.C., its chief purpose being to protect Negro
rights. It started out as noncommunist, and James W. Ford
complained in 1936 that although “The National Negro Congress
did not adopt a Communist program ... we Communists
stand one hundred per cent behind it in its efforts to unite the
Negro people....”</p>

<p>By 1940 communists had infiltrated the National Negro
Congress to such an extent that when its president, A. Philip
Randolph, “warned the Congress to stick to its principle and
remain nonpartisan ...” the communists staged a demonstration
and walked out, leaving only a third of the audience to
finish hearing Randolph. This 1940 convention of the National
Negro Congress passed a resolution condemning the war as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
“imperialist,” and drew from a communist writer the observation
that the congress had “only acted in accord with the fundamental
interests of the Negro people.”</p>

<p>In 1947 the National Negro Congress merged with the Civil
Rights Congress, an out-and-out communist front which has
recently dissolved.</p>

<p>The old International Labor Defense (ILD) also tried to
influence the American Negro, and came into conflict with the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
as a result of the ILD’s communist tactics in converting the
Scottsboro (Alabama) Case into a vehicle for communist
propaganda. In this case nine Negro boys were indicted in
1931 on charges of having raped two white girls.</p>

<p>After the Scottsboro boys were first convicted, the NAACP
charged that the defense “fell considerably short of perfection,”
and then retained the late famed Chicago criminal lawyer,
Clarence Darrow, to represent the boys. In 1931 the late
Walter White, then head of the NAACP, said the <i>Daily
Worker</i> accused another defense attorney, Stephen R. Roddy,
“... of being a member of the Ku Klux Klan, of having conspired
with the prosecution to electrocute the nine boys, of
having been the inmate of an insane asylum.” According to
White, the communists also charged the NAACP “as being
‘in league with the lyncher-bosses of the South,’ as plotters to
‘murder the Scottsboro martyrs,’ as sycophantic ‘tools of the
capitalists.’” The NAACP withdrew from the case, recognizing
that the Communist Party was interested only in promoting
“Red Fascism” in America.</p>

<p>George S. Schuyler, an editor of the <i>Pittsburgh Courier</i>, reflected
the consensus of American Negroes when he concluded,
“... The record shows that where and when the Communists
seemed to be fighting for Negro rights, their object
was simply to strengthen the hand of Russia.”</p>

<p class="tb">In similar fashion the Communist Party has long considered
foreign-language groups in the United States fertile fields for
infiltration. Since many of the early comrades were foreign-born,
agitation among national groups became a natural outlet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
for Party activity. In recent years the Nationality Groups Commission
has coordinated agitation in this field.</p>

<p>The Party has attempted to use national groups, among
other things, to exert pressure for changes in American foreign
policy. Pressure campaigns are organized, petitions circulated,
testimonials secured, hoping to make the government believe
that a national group, such as the Italians, Hungarians, or
Slovaks, supports the line desired by the Party. Party-controlled
newspapers grind out accompanying propaganda.</p>

<p>Party fronts have been particularly active among national
groups. The communists always make strenuous efforts to infiltrate
and capture fraternal insurance societies serving national
groups. As we have seen, such tactics give the Party a
ready base, along with somebody else’s money, for further
agitation. The Party, moreover, always likes to pose as the
“protector” of national cultures. Hence, it often sponsors nationality
bazaars, picnics, and dances, where costumes from
native lands are worn and native music is played. After the
Soviet conquest of Eastern Europe, however, the Party had
increasing difficulty trying to peddle the “glories” of communism.
Too much information was received from the old
homelands describing true conditions behind the Iron Curtain.</p>

<p>Minority groups, like other patriotic organizations, have
realized that no communist-created Utopia can compete with
the American way of life. The ability of the communists to
propagate their false doctrines is a challenge to our educational
process. We need to counter communism by making
the hopes and aspirations of the American ideal a reality for
all to enjoy.</p>

<i>The Communist Attack on Judaism</i></h3>

</div>

<p>The communist propaganda machine with its tactics of infiltration
and division has long fostered the false claim of widespread
influence in the Jewish communities of America. One
of the most malicious myths that has developed in the United
States is that persons of the Jewish faith and communists have
something in common. The people who gave the world the
concept of our monotheistic God and the Ten Commandments
cannot remain Jews and follow the atheism of Karl Marx and
the deceit of the communist movement.</p>

<p>It is a matter of record that numerous Communist Party
leaders call themselves Jews and claim a Jewish origin. This
does not, however, make them Jews, any more than William
Z. Foster’s Catholic background and Earl Browder’s Protestant
background give them any standing in present-day Catholic
and Protestant communities in the United States.</p>

<p>One highly placed Party leader recently pointed out that it
was necessary for communists working in Jewish groups to
represent themselves as Jews. This, of course, is a tactical
maneuver. Such a technique, the leader urged, “can be duplicated.”</p>

<p>Typical of communist claims which have led to the false
myth indicating that Jews have an affinity for communism are
the remarks of Paul Novick, the editor of the <i>Morning Freiheit</i>,
a communist paper published in Yiddish in New York City.
Novick said: “The development of Yiddish literature in the
United States went hand-in-hand with the growth of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
Socialist movement at the beginning of this century and of the
Communist Party after the October Revolution.” On the same
occasion Novick then went on to brand the followers of Judaism
for “... degeneration sown among the Jews by reaction....”
and then condemned their opposition to “... the progressive
movement, against the Soviet Union and against
Communism....” Novick revealed his true loyalties in December,
1956, in an article in the <i>Morning Freiheit</i> after the display
of Soviet brutality in Hungary with the apology that
there was an anti-Semitic and fascist element in the Hungarian
uprising, and insisted that, “... we must not only approve
the Soviet actions in Hungary, but really appreciate it!”</p>

<p>The widely read Jewish newspaper, <i>Jewish Daily Forward</i>,
on February 16, 1957, effectively identified Novick in a story
captioned “Editor of Communist ‘Freiheit’ Is Bitter Enemy of
the Jewish People.” Here it was asserted that after the Hitler-Stalin
pact the <i>Freiheit</i> justified and praised it, which caused
writers to leave and Novick made sure that those who remained
wrote without error following the pro-Hitler line. The
newspaper further revealed that Novick had gone out of his
way to prove that the communist dictators in Czechoslovakia
were correct in arresting Rudolph Slansky (and thirteen former
communist leaders, eleven of whom were Jews) and that
the arrested Moscow Jewish doctors were involved in a conspiracy
to poison Stalin. The <i>Jewish Daily Forward</i> article flatly
said that “anti-Semitic poison just poured out” of Novick.</p>

<p>One Party member, after having been in the Party for
twenty-five years and having held high Party offices, explained
to our agents that when he joined the Party he had renounced
the existence of God, that he had tried to impose on others his
atheistic views, and that he was “not a religious Jew.” He flatly
said that most Party members he knew who claimed to be
Jews did not follow their religion; they did not attend the
synagogue, although they did not work on religious holidays;
and the comrades who claimed to be Jews took no part in
organized Jewish religious activities.</p>

<p>Some of the most effective opposition to communism in the
United States has come from Jewish organizations such as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
B’nai B’rith, the American Jewish Committee, the American
Jewish League Against Communism, the Anti-Defamation
League, and a host of other Jewish groups.</p>

<p>The reasons for the extensive activities of the Communist
Party in seeking to infiltrate and make extravagant claims for
its work in some Jewish organizations and those of other minority
groups are readily apparent. In the Soviet Union, the
proving ground for Marxism-Leninism, communists are confronted
with a minority problem of staggering proportions.
Only 58 per cent of the population in the Soviet Union is Russian
whereas 42 per cent is non-Russian and consists of 168
national minorities.</p>

<p>The Bolsheviks prior to 1917 sought to win support from
minorities by defending their rights and developing such
propaganda come-ons as “self-determination of nations,” “national
cultural autonomy,” and so on. Once in power, the communists
soon forgot their promises but continued to pay lip
service to minority rights. The Soviet Union still retains the
“legal fiction” that it is a voluntary federation of union republics,
each of which is free to secede if it wishes. In fact,
Article 17 of the Soviet Constitution of 1936 states, “The right
freely to secede from the USSR is reserved to each constituent
republic.” No “republic,” however, has ever tried to secede,
and the possibility is remote indeed, as long as the Red army
responds to the will of the dictators in the Kremlin as it did in
Hungary.</p>

<p>A more important reason for communist interest in minorities
in the United States is, of course, the opportunities they
provide for exploitation and propaganda. The large number of
communist fronts using the word “Jewish,” as well as publications
that the communists dominate, is for the obvious purpose
of conveying a false impression of strength among those who
embrace the Jewish faith. This also accounts in part for the
literary interest communists devote to the problems of Jews.
Prior to issuing the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>, Karl Marx, the
atheist, wrote a treatise called, “On the Jewish Question”
which sets forth his views regarding Judaism and Jewish culture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>From that time to this in dealing with those of the Jewish
faith, the communists invariably do so in terms of discussing
“the Jewish question.” In fact, by this propaganda technique
the communists deliberately try to make the Jews a “problem,”
which is denied by the record of good citizenship and
civic responsibility of adherents of Judaism in the United
States. As an example: The American Jewish League Against
Communism stated as early as 1948 that “Soviet Russia’s million
and a half Jews are the forgotten people of the world.”
The League lists among its proudest achievements that “... it
was the first American organization to expose and document
the communist anti-Jewish policies.”</p>

<p>A true follower of the Jewish faith, like those of other religions,
cannot embrace communism. Marxism-Leninism is irrevocably
opposed to all religious beliefs and all forms of
worship, whether they be Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or
Moslem. One of Lenin’s basic teachings is, “We must combat
religion—this is the A.B.C. of <i>all</i> materialism, and consequently
of Marxism.... The Marxist must be a materialist, i.e., an
enemy of religion....”</p>

<p>In theory and practice the communists make no distinction
among any of the world’s greater religions, as the leading
Soviet crusader against religion, E. Yaroslavsky, makes clear:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... the priests of every cult have their own way of deluding
the masses: the Jewish rabbi, the Roman Catholic priest, the
Russian Orthodox priest, the Mohammedan mullah, the Evangelist,
Baptist and other ministers of religion, each has his own
way of fooling the people.... As to differences between one
religion and another, they are of little, if any, consequence....</p>

</div>

<p>If there was ever any doubt that the communists were even
lukewarm toward the Jewish faith, it was resolved by Yaroslavsky,
onetime head of the League of Militant Atheists in the
Soviet Union, who said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The Jewish synagogues were not granted any privileges whatsoever
by the Russian state, but they were fully supported by
the Jewish bourgeoisie. The Jewish rabbinate, like its sister<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
priestcrafts, drew close to the side of the rich because the
Jewish church had also incorporated in its <i>credo</i> the justification
of the existence of exploiting classes in society....</p>

</div>

<p>Karl Marx described Judaism as “anti-social” and an expression
of Jewish “egoism.” Marx, better than any other communist
leader, illustrates the gulf between Jewish tradition and
communism. He could not be loyal to both, so in accepting
the communist ideal, he was not content to reject Jewish tradition;
he had to malign it and seek to destroy it with such bitterness
as: “Money is the jealous God of Israel, by the side of
which no other god may exist.... Exchange is the Jew’s real
God.”</p>

<p>The unrestrained emotional outbursts of Hitler against the
Jews were reminiscent of the Marxian tirades against Judaism.</p>

<p>The Marxian denunciation of Judaism is not limited to invective.
From the earliest days when communism came to
power in the Soviet Union, communists have conducted a systematic
campaign to cripple and destroy organized Judaism.
On January 23, 1918, the Soviets issued a sweeping decree
“On the Separation of the Church from the State, and of the
School from the Church.” All church property was nationalized;
churches were denied rights of legal recourse; the teaching
of religion was banned in public and private schools; the
right of people to attend religious services on workdays was
revoked; and records of births, marriages, and deaths were
taken from the churches and put under the exclusive control
of civil authorities.</p>

<p>While religious services were still allowed, the clergy was
reduced to the status of second-class citizenship; a campaign
of terror was launched leading to the arrest and imprisonment
or execution of priests, rabbis, ministers, and other church
leaders on such vague charges as “counter-revolutionary activity”
or “crimes against the people.” Physical destruction of
church property was conveniently explained as the “spontaneous”
acts of “aroused” peasants and workers to conceal the
real perpetrators, Soviet officialdom.</p>

<p>The main target, of course, was the Orthodox Church, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
had long been the state church of Russia; but all other faiths
suffered, including that of the Jews. The reports of refugees as
compiled by Wladyslaw Kania in the book, <i>Bolshevism and
Religion</i>, published by the Polish Library in New York City
in 1946, prove the hypocrisy of the Soviet claim of minority
protection with accounts as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Jews are morally persecuted, the young Jewish population
is being brought up in un-religious ways....</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>The Jews in Russia are living only on the memories of the
happy past....</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>... during the Jewish feast Purim ... the Jews, Soviet citizens,
assembled for evening prayer. One of the neighbors reported
them to the NKVD. The premises were raided and the
host arrested and sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p>The rabbis have been deported; “kosher” meat, etc., though
promised, does not exist.... The synagogues and houses of
worship have been closed....</p>

</div>

<p>General Walter Bedell Smith, after his three years as Ambassador
to the Soviet Union, reported that in June, 1948,
about thirty churches were open in Moscow, which included
one Jewish synagogue for an estimated 300,000 Jews. During
World War II General Smith reported, “But two religions—the
Jewish and the Roman Catholic—did not gain even temporary
benefits from the wartime policy of greater religious tolerance;
in fact, on balance, it is probably safe to say that attacks upon
them have been stepped up rather than relaxed in recent
years.”</p>

<p>Communist reports on the state of Jews in the Soviet Union
make little reference to Judaism as practiced. For example,
the forty-seven-page communist propaganda pamphlet, written
by Paul Novick and J. M. Budish, entitled <i>Jews in the
Soviet Union</i>, makes only this single reference to Judaism:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Then, there are Jewish religious activities. I visited the main
synagogue in Moscow during Yom Kippur. It was over-crowded,
with people outside listening to the cantor through
loud speakers.... I visited synagogues in Kiev, Vilna, Berditchev,
Zhytomir. There are about 300 organized religious communities
in the U.S.S.R....</p>

</div>

<p>The accuracy of this report is highly questionable, bearing
in mind the cold, systematic communist program of extinguishing
religion. Among the tactics employed by the Communist
Party of the Soviet Union has been the liquidation of the traditional
Jewish school system, including the primary school
(Hedder), the secondary schools (the Talmud Torah), and
the rabbinical school (the Jeshiva). Thus, when the present
generation of Soviet Jews passes on, there will be no more
rabbis.</p>

<p>This attack on Judaism becomes apparent when the role of
the rabbi is considered. He is not merely a preacher; he is the
teacher of Jewish moral law, the ritualistic laws governing the
home, family, and individual; he presides at such religious
ceremonies as the marriage, sits in ritualistic courts and supervises
circumcisions and the preparation of kosher meat. Hence,
in abolishing the rabbinical schools, the Soviets are gradually
seeking the extinction of Judaism without a pogrom. Judaism
cannot exist unless Hebrew is taught so that rabbis can study
the Torah and Talmud in the original language in which
they were written.</p>

<p>Communist practice and communist theory are in direct
conflict. Communism, as we have seen, is essentially an international
class movement and therefore regards national loyalty,
other than communist loyalty, as a potential menace. The
communists use “national rights” as a propaganda device and
support national movements only when it serves the interests
of the Soviet regime.</p>

<p>The communist propaganda line directed to Jewish people
follows three general themes:</p>

<p class="tb">1. The Soviet Union offers the Jewish people complete freedom.
As one apologist put it: “There is one spot on the earth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
where the Jewish people are not under increasing pressure,
one spot where the Jews have full equality.... That is the
socialist Soviet Union.”</p>

<p class="tb">2. The Soviets have created a national homeland for Russian
Jews in the Jewish autonomous region of Birobidzhan (or
Birobidjan), where they claim Jewish culture is flourishing.</p>

<p class="tb">3. In World War II the U.S.S.R. saved thousands of Jews
from certain death from the Nazis.</p>

<p>Standing by themselves, these claims admittedly make an
impressive appeal. If true, they would even justify the extravagant
claim of Alexander Bittelman, who recently was released
from prison upon completing a federal sentence for conspiring
to advocate the overthrow of the government of the United
States by force and violence. Bittelman, long one of the chief
interpreters of communism to the Jewish people, has described
the Soviet Union as the “saviour of the Jewish people.” The
record, however, demolishes this propaganda line as a collection
of half-truths, exaggerations, and outright deceptions.</p>

<p>At best, Soviet tolerance toward Jewish culture was never
anything more than a temporary political tactic. And even
then the Soviet claims were contemporaneous with the 1917
revolution, when the communists were seeking support from
all quarters. Stalin’s <i>Marxism and the National Question</i>, the
acknowledged communist classic on the subject, though consisting
of 222 pages, contains only twenty pages written after
1927, with the most important single part having been written
in 1913. By the late 1930’s alleged concessions to the cultures
of the various minority groups gave way to a policy of forcible
denationalization rivaling the brutal “Russification” tactics of
the Czars.</p>

<p>To illustrate: In 1917 there were a total of forty-nine Yiddish
or Hebrew newspapers in the Soviet Union. By 1921
these had increased to sixty-two; but no less than fifty were
communist-controlled, while the forty-nine not under communist
control in 1917 had dwindled to twelve in 1921.</p>

<p>Jewish literature suffered a similar fate. From 1928 to 1933<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
books published in Yiddish rose from 238 to 668, but there
was a marked decline in books dealing with Jewish history
and tradition. In 1932 there were thirty-six books in Yiddish
classified as history—of these, sixteen were memoirs chiefly of
old Bolsheviks; six were studies on the Communist International;
six dealt with the revolution and history of the Communist
Party; five consisted of speeches of Stalin and other
communist leaders; and only three actually dealt with matters
pertaining to Jewish culture. These related to the labor movement
and were an attempt to rewrite history to conform with
Marxist-Leninist doctrine.</p>

<p>The Soviet purge trials of 1936-37 should have made clear
to the world the communist objective mercilessly to crush the
leadership of any minority groups whose cultural resurgence
conflicted with the advance of Marxism-Leninism. To cite an
example: of the ten representatives of minority groups who
served on the draft committee for the 1936 Soviet constitution,
only one was alive at the end of 1937. The other nine were
branded as “spies,” “enemies of the people,” and were shot,
committed suicide, or had disappeared.</p>

<p>The sad fate of the Jewish school system in the Ukraine
proves the lie to the Soviet propaganda claim of furthering
Jewish culture. In 1925, government reports reflected a total
of 39,474 students in the Ukrainian schools where Yiddish
was the language of instruction. In 1931 the number of such
students reached its peak of 90,000. By 1940 this figure had
declined to 50,000, and the Jewish schools were completely
suppressed when the Nazis took over the Ukraine in World
War II. Since the war the efforts of Jewish educators to have
the Soviet government construct new schools have apparently
failed.</p>

<p>One of the most crippling communist attacks on Jewish
culture has been prohibition of the use of Hebrew, the traditional
language of Judaism. As a tactic the Soviets launched
a program of “compulsory Yiddishizing” to destroy the influence
of Hebrew among Russian Jews. Yiddish is a jargon
based on a German dialect. It is unrelated to Hebrew. Many
Jews, particularly Asiatic and Mediterranean Jews, do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
know it at all. A similar program of suppression of Jewish institutions
shifted to the satellites after World War II, where
Jewish schools were abolished, Jewish organizations banned,
and even athletic clubs bearing Jewish names were forced to
change their names on twenty-four-hour notice.</p>

<p>The second propaganda claim of the Soviets in establishing
the Jewish homeland of Birobidzhan should be closely analyzed.
Solomon M. Schwarz, in his exhaustive study, <i>The
Jews in the Soviet Union</i>, exposes the Soviet propaganda for
the falsehood that it is. The so-called Jewish homeland was
set up at a time when the threat of Japanese and Chinese invasion
of the U.S.S.R.’s Far Eastern frontier was not idle.
Thus, the Jewish homeland was conceived as a means of populating
the vast spaces in the Far East of Russia, and also provided
a convenient place to settle Jews not wanted in other
parts of Russia.</p>

<p>By 1933 the Soviets envisioned a population of 60,000 Jews
in Birobidzhan. During its first six years 19,635 Jews arrived,
while 11,450 left, leaving a net gain of only 8185. By 1939,
after eleven years, the Soviet Jewish homeland could claim no
more than 30,000 Jews and by 1951 around 40,000 which
was a small community surrounded by Asiatic peoples completely
separated from the mainstream of Jewish life. Furthermore,
it is in the maritime provinces of Siberia, where the
climate is unsuitable for those accustomed to European life.</p>

<p>The third communist propaganda claim, that of rescuing
Jews from Nazi extinction, is also a deception. In the first
place, for two years prior to the Nazi invasion of Russia, when
Moscow was allied with Berlin, <i>there is no record of any
Soviet protest against the Nazi slaughter of Jews</i>, so far as is
known. The good-neighbor policy between the communists
and the Nazis, initiated by the Stalin-Hitler pact, is clearly
established by the following report sent by the German Ambassador
to Moscow to the German Foreign Office, where it
came to light after the war: “... The Soviet Government is
doing everything to change the attitude of the population
here toward Germany. The press is as though it had been
transformed....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>Later the Foreign Office was advised that:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>... the Soviet Government has always previously been able
in a masterly fashion to influence the attitude of the population
in the direction which it has desired, and it is not being sparing
this time either of the necessary propaganda.</p>

</div>

<p>Then, too, the silence of the Soviet leaders on the outbreaks
of Nazi anti-Semitism completely misled Eastern European
Jews as to the real character of the Nazi threat and hence,
some 2,000,000 Russian and Eastern European Jews made no
attempt to escape the Nazis during the early months of the
German invasion of Russia. And even after the Nazi onslaught,
there was a shocking failure on the part of the Soviets
to reveal Nazi atrocities against the Jews.</p>

<p>For example, the Soviet government in 1942 condemned
the “bloodthirsty, criminal plans of the fascists” aimed at exterminating
Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, and “other
peoples” of the Soviet Union, with no direct reference to the
Jews. As late as 1945 the Soviets in a report on the German
concentration camp at Auschwitz (Oswiecim), where more
than 4,000,000 persons were exterminated, did not even use
the word “Jew,” although they constituted the majority of
those whose lives were so brutally taken.</p>

<p>Not only did the communists in the Soviet Union fail to
make any special effort to save Jewish people during the war,
they showed no concern over their fate.</p>

<p>If further evidence is necessary to prove the falsity of communist
propaganda directed toward the Jewish people, it is
only necessary to look at the communist campaigns against
Zionism. The communist propagandist, Paul Novick, reflected
the communist line both in the Soviet Union and the United
States when he wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Ever since its inception Zionism has been an instrument of the
Jewish bourgeoisie to hamper the struggle of the Jewish
masses ... a means of diverting the attention of the Jewish
workers from the class struggle and of keeping them separated
from the progressive forces of other nationalities....</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>In the Soviet Union, Zionism is ruthlessly suppressed. In
the United States communists have a more complex problem
and avoid direct public attacks on the Zionist movement, so as
not to alienate that large section of Jewish people who favor
Zionism. The communist attacks are more subtle and are directed
essentially at individual Zionist leaders. The aim, of
course, is to discredit the Zionist movement without antagonizing
its rank-and-file members. The Party line changes from
time to time when it is expedient, but the communist objective
of eventually destroying Zionist influence among the Jewish
people, without alienating its rank-and-file members, has never
changed.</p>

<p>Khrushchev more recently reiterated the Party line against
the Zionist movement when he was asked what the Soviet
Union would do if the Zionists settled in Soviet territory and
demanded a state of their own. He replied with communist
contempt, “We have thrown them out of our country.”</p>

<p>Communist Party leaders in the United States exhibited
some concern over the Soviet campaign against Jews which
was brought to light by an anti-Zionist article in <i>Pravda</i> on
September 21, 1948, by Ilya Ehrenburg, which referred to
the state of Israel as a “bourgeois country.” This article declared
that in Russia there was no artificial division between
Jews and their Russian comrades but that Jews led lives in
common with other peoples of Russia. The proper solution to
the “Jewish problem,” according to Ehrenburg’s article, is the
abolishment of “nationalism” among Jews and the integration
of Jews into the existing society rather than their having a distinct
life apart from other people.</p>

<p>It is known that when the information in the Ehrenburg
article reached the United States, there were considerable concern
and confusion in the offices of the <i>Morning Freiheit</i> as to
whether the article represented a fixed Soviet policy. The fact
that <i>Pravda</i> is under Soviet Communist Party control causes
Party leaders in this country to give careful consideration to
anything it publishes. The matter was resolved by directing
an inquiry to Itzik Feffer, a friend of Stalin in Moscow, to
secure the correct Soviet line on the Jewish question. The report<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
came back to the United States that Ehrenburg merely
was reflecting his own ideas, along with some of the younger
communists of Jewish origin, and did not represent the correct
policy of the Soviet Union. The then foreign editor of the
<i>Morning Freiheit</i>, Moise Katz, in an article appearing in the
January, 1949, issue of <i>Yiddishe Kultur</i> criticized the ideas
appearing in the Ehrenburg article.</p>

<p>Events, however, were to prove the correctness of Ehrenburg’s
statements, which became the fixed policy of the Soviet
Union, and the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee, of which Itzik
Feffer was a member, was abolished. In the meantime the
National Committee of the Communist Party intervened and,
according to reports, straightened out the <i>Morning Freiheit</i> on
the new Soviet line. A letter of apology over the signature of
Moise Katz then appeared in the <i>Freiheit</i> on March 29, 1949.
This incident was discussed in communist circles and the word
leaked out that three writers were discharged from the <i>Freiheit</i>
for “bourgeois nationalism.”</p>

<p>When Khrushchev denounced Stalin at the Twentieth Congress
of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in Moscow
in February, 1956, news of the long-pent-up acts of oppression
against Jews in the Soviet Union began to leak out. It is,
of course, significant that Khrushchev made no mention of the
mistreatment of the Jews in his exposure of Stalin, whom he
had so loyally served over the years.</p>

<p>Within a few weeks, as noted in Chapter 3, the disclosures
of anti-Semitism came in the Warsaw, Poland, Yiddish-language
communist newspaper <i>Folks-Shtimme</i> on April 4, 1956,
regarding the Soviet purges of Jewish leaders and culture under
Stalin. Later, on April 13, 1956, the <i>Daily Worker</i> expressed
regrets and then admitted “... we were too prone to
accept the explanation of why Jewish culture had disappeared
in the Soviet Union in the late 1940s.” With the agility of
“whirling dervishes” the communists then sought to develop a
justification for the Soviet communist leaders’ action.</p>

<p>World public opinion over the Soviet communist leaders’
injustices mounted and as Khrushchev turned on the “smiles”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
and started visiting other countries, he was confronted with
the accusation of anti-Semitism in Russia.</p>

<p>In England, Khrushchev characterized “anti-Semitism” as
“nonsense” to which he would not listen. To a French delegation
he protested that he was not anti-Semitic but that the
Yiddish language is fading away in Russia as the Jews in the
Soviet Union are learning to speak Russian. A new low in deception
was reached when Khrushchev claimed that, in the
early years of the revolution, “Jews occupied a disproportionately
large number of high Soviet positions because the country
had few trained people.” He then asserted that the Kremlin
had received protests from “the various Soviet Republics
that too many Jews held desirable positions.” The New York
<i>Times</i> story on June 10, 1956, then reported that Khrushchev
“... reportedly pressed Lazar M. Kaganovich, only high-ranking
Soviet leader of Jewish origin, to confirm his statements,
which Mr. Kaganovich finally did, saying one word,
‘correct’....” And now there are no top communist leaders in
the Kremlin of Jewish origin since Khrushchev ousted and denounced
Kaganovich last summer.</p>

<p>The president of B’nai B’rith, Philip M. Klutznick, answered
the communist propaganda claims when he made the factual
observation that only in Soviet Russia and its satellites is “Jewish
life languishing and approaching extinction.”</p>

<p>The Communist Party of the United States at its February,
1957, convention sought to hoodwink the American public by
a series of statements to the press of how it had declared its
independence from Moscow. This deceit was established in no
unmistakable terms by the handling of a resolution dealing
with anti-Semitism in Russia. The resolution was submitted
by Professor Morris U. Schappes in typical communist language:
“Resolution: On Jewish question, some aspects.”</p>

<p>The resolution stated: “This matter concerns us as Communists
in a country which includes 5,000,000 Jews.” It then
points out,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Since the Jewish question is international in scope, we communists
must be alert to the problem and its world-wide<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
aspects. The Jewish question is a specific question that requires
specific attention.... The liquidation of the outstanding Yiddish
writers and Jewish communal and political leaders, and
the snuffing out of organized Jewish cultural life have been
known for some time....</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">He, of course, was referring to anti-Semitism in Russia.</p>

<p>The resolution called for the creation of a Jewish Commission,
a return to Leninist policy, and a request “... to make
this subject one for fraternal discussion with the Communist
Party in the Soviet Union,” which, of course, negates the view
of independence of the communists in the United States.</p>

<p>The resolution was soft-pedaled and disposed of, as was a
similar resolution dealing with Soviet terrorism in Hungary,
by being referred to the National Committee of the Party.
<i>Pravda</i>, on February 16, 1957, had this to say: “The 16th Convention
of the Communist Party, USA, confirmed the loyalty
of the American communists to the principles of Marxism-Leninism....”</p>

<p>Party leaders, however, in the face of the overwhelming
evidence of communist hate for the followers of Moses, still
are attempting to deceive unsuspecting persons of Jewish
origin and, as this is being written, communist tacticians are
at work on a program of infiltrating Jewish groups by seeking
for the answers to such questions as:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—How to avoid the extremes of negating Israel and of accepting
its actions uncritically.</p>

<p class="hanging">—How to work in religious groups while keeping ourselves and
our children free of the religious doctrine of these groups.</p>

<p class="hanging">—How to avoid the extremes of taking on all issues and avoiding
all issues.</p>

<p class="hanging">—How to balance Jewish work with our interests as Marxists in
general trade union, minorities and people’s movements.</p>

</div>

<p>The vigilant and patriotic members of Jewish organizations
have demonstrated their alertness to counteract the infiltration
tactics in Jewish institutions by communists who were born
Jews. Where communist infiltration tactics have succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
Jewish organizations, it has been because of a failure on the
part of leaders and members alike to be vigilant and thwart
the communist tactic of infiltration into the Jewish community
just as it has sought to infiltrate every other organization.</p>

<p>A <i>Pravda</i> editorial on July 6, 1956, should remove all
doubts as to the antipathy of communism to those who worship
God regardless of their faith:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As for our country the Communist Party has been and will
be the only master of the minds, and thoughts, the spokesman,
leader and organizer of the people in their entire struggle for
communism.</p>

<i>How the Underground Works</i></h3>

</div>

<p>The communist above-ground, as we have seen, constantly
seeks to represent itself as a legitimate political organization
working for the best interests of America. When large segments
of the people are hoodwinked into believing this fraudulent
claim, it becomes easier for the Party to carry on its
revolutionary propaganda through mass agitation, infiltration,
and fronts. Without some degree of public acceptance, the
Party is doomed to an isolated impotence.</p>

<p>Communist tactics require that above-ground activities be
pushed as far as possible. However, when the Party begins to
abuse its constitutional privileges and the government takes
steps to protect itself from outright treason and subversion,
more and more Party activities are shifted underground, that
is, to the illegal apparatus. As Lenin taught, the Party must
always have two levels, above-ground and underground. Both
must exist at the same time. One without the other is incomplete.</p>

<p>In times of “nonprosecution”—that is, when “hostile” governments
are not attacking—the Party, like a submarine, will
surface, carrying on the bulk of its work above ground. But a
portion (the underground) will always stay submerged, concealing
the Party’s illegal activities, such as aid to Soviet espionage;
endeavoring to place concealed members in sensitive
positions in government, education, and industry, maintaining
clandestine communication networks.</p>

<p>In event of an emergency, this undercarriage quickly expands,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
providing the Party with well-prepared and extensive
undercover operations. Within days, hundreds of above-ground
comrades can be absorbed. The Party submerges, the
above-ground shrinks.</p>

<p>The Party will submerge only as long and as deep as absolutely
necessary, always preferring surface operations (with a
supporting underground). That’s why it desperately fights all
legislation curtailing its activities. Only to prevent annihilation
will it go completely underground. This action reduces
contact with the masses, wastes energy on nonproductive
security measures, and decreases effectiveness. Except for outright
liquidation, it is practically impossible to drive the Party
completely underground or completely above ground.</p>

<p>As we saw in Chapters 4 and 5, the Party experienced two
periods of intensified underground activities: (1) shortly after
its founding, and (2) in the mid-1951 to mid-1955 period.
Both were caused primarily by prosecutive action of state and
federal governments.</p>

<p>To understand the underground we must realize that it is a
maze of undercover couriers, escape routes, hide-outs, and
clandestine meetings. It’s not the place for the beginner, the
half-indoctrinated, or the doubtful. Only the most loyal members
are selected. These men and women are carrying on the
Party’s deceitful work away from the watchful eye (so they
hope) of the FBI and other governmental agencies.</p>

<p>It was early in the morning. The taxi had been summoned
to a number on James Street. The driver looked. On the corner
stood an attractive woman, dressed in a polka-dotted
blouse and navy blue skirt. From her shoulder dangled a
brown purse.</p>

<p>“Take me to Elm and Cherry Streets,” she said, jumping
into the cab.</p>

<p>When the taxi arrived at the destination, the woman
changed her mind. “Take me to the Surplus Store,” she instructed.
The driver complied, now almost doubling back to
where he had started. The woman, however, still wasn’t satisfied.
She asked to be taken to another location. There she
alighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>A few minutes later she hailed another cab and went
straight to her destination, a railroad station on the east side
of town, some fifteen miles away, even though she was then
only a short distance from a terminal where she could have
caught the same train.</p>

<p>This wasn’t the Case of the Woman Who Changed Her
Mind, but the shift of a Party underground leader to a new
hide-out. Why the strange gyrations? She was endeavoring to
make certain she wasn’t being followed.</p>

<p>In a northern state a scene similar to the Girl in the Polka-dotted
Blouse was being enacted. A woman with black curly
hair, dressed in a smart gray herringbone suit and wearing a
large-brimmed hat, boarded a southbound train. She carefully
surveyed the passengers, then took a seat near the rear. She
was carrying on her left arm a blue tweed suit and a hook-weave
black coat. In her right hand she held a brown suitcase
trimmed in light tan. It was a long ride, all afternoon and
night. Upon arrival she sped to an address in an older section
of town. A knock, the door opened, and she disappeared inside.
The woman was a high-ranking Party leader reporting
for a new underground assignment.</p>

<p>These two women, neatly dressed and looking like ordinary
travelers, were but two of many hundreds involved in Party
underground work from 1951 to 1955. Many were away from
home for months, even years, living under assumed names in
obscure rooms; moving under cover of darkness from one city
to another; scurrying along streets late at night; eating irregular
meals. Life in the underground for most is hard work,
drudgery; not romance, adventure, and fun.</p>

<p>How are comrades chosen for underground work?</p>

<p>As we have seen, only the most trusted and dedicated of
Party members are chosen. A study of the case histories of
twenty-five top Party leaders active in the underground during
1951-55 disclosed that all had been in the communist
movement for over twenty years. Their average age was somewhat
over forty.</p>

<p>Party “loyalty” is determined by an elaborate “verification”
system. A prospect is compelled to execute a questionnaire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
asking for detailed information about his family, former employment,
education, Party history. One questionnaire, for example,
requested a member to analyze the “political position”
of relatives, and then asked, “Have you had any extra-marital
relations since you’ve been married? If so, with whom and how
often?” Many times, older comrades must vouch for the prospect.</p>

<p>To enter the underground usually means simply disappearing
quickly, abruptly, without warning. Whispers float:
“Where’s Gordon?” The answer: “He’s gone under” or merely
the telltale sign, a clenched fist with the thumb pointed down.</p>

<p>It was a Monday morning. Everybody came to work except
one, a woman who had been with the firm for many years.
Nobody thought anything about it. Probably she was sick. But
the next day, the next week, the next month, she didn’t return,
although she had almost a hundred dollars in wages coming to
her. At her apartment it was the same story. She had quickly
moved out. Nobody knew where she had gone.</p>

<p>She had entered the communist underground.</p>

<p>These departures are carefully planned. Above-ground comrades
will handle any pending personal matters, such as storing
the member’s furniture, moving his family, caring for his
car. Sometimes departures have been so rapid that hot meals
have been left on the table.</p>

<p>Once underground, the member is made ready for assignment.
This means, first of all, assuming a new identity; that
is, being made into “another person.” As a general rule this
involves the securing of a new name, date, and place of birth,
even changing physical appearance. One functionary, for example,
lost between thirty-five and forty pounds, giving him a
gaunt appearance. Others were told to gain weight. Still another
grew a mustache, donned glasses, and dyed his hair
black. Identification marks, such as moles and warts, have
been removed by surgery. One underground official boasted
that he could walk down Main Street every day and even his
wife could not recognize him!</p>

<p>In addition, the member must be supplied with fake identification
papers, Social Security cards, drivers’ licenses, library<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
cards, bank-deposit books. If he is stopped on the street he
must be able to prove his “identity.” Likewise, he should acquaint
himself with his adopted place of birth, know something
about its newspapers, streets, and stores. Does it have a
baseball team? It’s usually best to pick a small town, for there
is less chance of meeting somebody from there.</p>

<p>Frequently the member, in his new pose, will attempt, at
least on a temporary basis, to secure employment. His underground
work will be conducted in the evenings and on week
ends. Some of the comrades are on the Party’s payroll, but
most are not. One member became, in the words of her employer,
an “efficient, affable, and able” secretary. Little did he
dream that she was a communist on special underground assignment.
In another instance a comrade, when hired for a
job, said she was born in a Southern city, had attended a certain
grade and high school, and had previously worked in another
city. Later FBI investigation revealed that her story was
a complete falsehood. Her job was only a front for secret communist
work.</p>

<p>That’s why the underground is a nightmare of deceit, fear,
and tension, where one has to tell falsehoods, fabricate a background,
adopt a new name, and live in fear of being recognized
by old friends or acquaintances.</p>

<p>Suppose the Girl in the Polka-dotted Blouse, in order to
carry out an assignment, must pose as a widow or the estranged
wife of a sea captain, or as the retired owner of a
ladies’ dress shop? Think of the problems that would arise.
What types of stories must be improvised? What kind of personal
possessions must be purchased to keep up the cover?</p>

<p>The Party has thoroughly studied these problems. Let’s
look at a secret study issued for the instruction of women underground
comrades, like the Girl in the Polka-dotted Blouse.
Here’s the advice:</p>

<p class="tb">1. Suppose you are posing as a widow (after having been
married some twenty years) and you have now come to this
city “to get away from it all and try to forget.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p class="hanging2"><i>Answer</i>: Well, you shouldn’t come in (as to a rooming house)
empty-handed, with only a handbag. You “must make
some show of previous accumulation,” for example,
have “a few personal ‘precious’ things,” such as “picture(s),
little mementoes.” Where can you get them?
“In any 5-10c store.”</p>

<p class="tb">2. Suppose you have an inquisitive landlady who has access
to your apartment.</p>

<p class="hanging2"><i>Answer</i>: You might first say (to cover up the scarcity of your
personal belongings) that, being so sad over becoming
a widow, you “haven’t had the heart to unpack
everything yet.” If you stay longer, you better buy a
dustmop and some other items, “so that the story of
having been a housewife for so many years will ring
true.” And by all means have some luggage, preferably
“beat-up” luggage. “The more luggage a woman
moves in with the better is she accepted on the
strength of her story.”</p>

<p class="tb">3. What if you’re underground in a small town? What about
social life? People are sure to become suspicious if you stay
seven nights a week at home. Moreover, unlike a man, it
doesn’t look right to go to a late movie alone.</p>

<p class="hanging2"><i>Answer</i>: Take a short trip out of town. This not only takes
away suspicion but gives you something to talk
about.</p>

<p class="tb">4. Then there is the problem of extra expense incurred by
women.</p>

<p class="hanging2"><i>Answer</i>: A woman must have more luggage (she’s expected
to have more clothing, etc.). Then she must use a
taxi; she can’t carry her own suitcases. Also there is
the problem of “personal upkeep.” Suppose you are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
a blonde and you come into town as a brunette. As
the study points out, you have to keep that up, to a
tune of about six dollars for each trip to the beauty
parlor and two dollars extra for eyebrow dye.</p>

<p class="tb">Attention to detail must be exacting, even to the clothes
worn on given occasions. Here’s a sample of a “How I was
Dressed” diary kept by the Girl in the Polka-dotted Blouse:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—wore dark grey dress, high heels, walked to the movie ...</p>

<p class="hanging">—wore low heels, two-piece blue suit, red tam ...</p>

<p class="hanging">—wore high heels, white blouse and blue hankie. Carried umbrella,
looked like rain.</p>

</div>

<p>In meeting noncommunists she doesn’t want to be a strawberry
blonde one day and the next week a natural brunette.
If she is representing herself as a “poor widow,” she probably
should wear the same dress every time, not come in a variety
of outfits.</p>

<p>Assignments in the underground vary. A select few are engaged
in highly secret disciplinary work. Security is most important.
The telephone and mails are to be avoided. Never
carry Party documents or names on your person. Disciplinary
squads may stop members and search their purses. Woe if a
compromising slip of paper is found bearing a name or telephone
number.</p>

<p>Security precautions also affect the above-ground Party. No
membership books (or cards) are issued; large clubs are broken
up into small groups; records are destroyed. In a Western state
a Party member was instructed to go to the post office for
mail. He was to carry a brown paper sack and, upon leaving,
proceed to the restroom of a nearby building. There another
Party member, carrying an identical brown sack containing
nothing but rubbish, would meet him. They would exchange
sacks. In this way, so it was thought, the person with the mail
could not be detected.</p>

<p>Then there are couriers who carry secret messages, often in
code. In addition, they bring supplies and funds, meet Party<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
leaders in hide-outs, contact mail drops. Couriers are of various
types: (1) Party officials “just going through,” (2) Party
members, such as salesmen and truck drivers, whose occupations
allow them to travel without suspicion, (3) “professional”
couriers who are trained to operate on a full-time basis.</p>

<p>Some comrades are given special assignments, such as stock-piling
supplies (paper, ink, printing presses, funds). Others,
working with above-ground comrades, secure, for future underground
use, extra drivers’ licenses, birth certificates, car
titles, etc. In addition, comrades operate hide-outs and escape
routes or hide Party records. The underground from 1951 to
1955 actually harbored Party leaders who were criminal fugitives,
having been convicted by United States courts.</p>

<p>Depending on local conditions, the organizational structure
of the underground varies from area to area. As a general rule,
because of security reasons, the leadership is rotated. The
Party may feel that a member is going “stale.” If so, he may
be shifted to another assignment or temporarily “furloughed
upstairs” (meaning allowed to reappear in the “open”). A
reserve leadership is always ready, in case the functioning
leaders are arrested or otherwise incapacitated. This reserve
may consist of other underground comrades or members still
“upstairs.”</p>

<p>On the West Coast, for example, a clandestine communist
group using the code name of “Mollie” had full responsibility
for carrying through not only underground but also many
above-ground functions. For security reasons underground
contacts are always downward, not to a higher level. This
means that top officials can contact those in lower levels, but
the latter (who seldom even know the identity of their superiors)
cannot contact above themselves. In event of an “enemy
breakthrough,” only the identity of those on the level “broken
through,” or lower level, will be revealed.</p>

<p>As we have mentioned, the closest cooperation must exist
between the underground and above-ground apparatuses. The
former cannot operate as a self-contained unit. It must constantly
be serviced from above; otherwise it would die of suffocation.
As we noticed in Chapter 17, communist fronts serve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
as periscopes to the “upper world” through which funds, supplies,
and instructions are funneled. The deeper the Party goes
underground, the greater the reliance on fronts.</p>

<p>The overriding consideration of the underground is security,
not to be discovered by the FBI. Let’s see how this affects the
Party’s operations.</p>

<h4>Hide-outs</h4>

<p>Generally speaking the underground uses three types of
hide-outs: (1) <i>temporary</i>, an abode for a courier or Party
member en route to another destination. This will probably
be a room in the home of a “politically reliable” individual;
(2) <i>emergency</i>, a home or apartment where a member, perhaps
feeling he is being watched or suddenly becoming sick,
can hide on an emergency basis. It is not to be used too frequently;
(3) <i>permanent</i>, or “deep freeze,” where one or more
comrades can remain for extended periods, maybe a month,
or even a year, with all necessities being provided. Farms or
cabins in remote areas make excellent “deep freezes.”</p>

<p>Here are some of the requirements demanded for a “safe”
hide-out. They illustrate the Party’s attention to detail.</p>

<p>1. The owner must be absolutely loyal to the Party.</p>

<p>2. If an apartment, there must be no doorman or elevator
operator. A walk-up apartment of three or four stories is preferable.</p>

<p>3. If a family home, the members must be thoroughly reliable.
There should be no children, relatives, or maids.</p>

<p>4. The proprietor should not be too closely identified with
the Party, either as a sympathizer or member.</p>

<p>5. The hide-out must be located where there are no curious
or talkative neighbors.</p>

<p>6. The quarters must be sufficiently large to accommodate
extra guests. Excessive cramping attracts attention.</p>

<p>7. The neighborhood should be well known to the owner
and one in which some trusted friends reside. In this way any
inquiries in the vicinity will immediately come to their attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span></p>

<h4>Meetings</h4>

<p>Elaborate security must surround all underground contacts,
whether between just two people or groups. Here are a few
points the underground has to remember:</p>

<p>1. Don’t use the same meeting place too frequently. It
might excite suspicion.</p>

<p>2. If a meeting is held at a home, a member of the family
(who, of course, is thoroughly reliable) should be there to answer
the door in case an outsider knocks. He can handle the
situation and also serve as a lookout.</p>

<p>3. If large numbers are involved, times of arrival and departure
should be staggered. Everybody should not arrive or
depart at the same time.</p>

<p>4. If the comrades don’t know each other, a predetermined
means of identification (a code word, piece of clothing, etc.)
should be used.</p>

<p>5. Bring no more documents (books, papers, etc.) than
absolutely necessary. Avoid note-taking. Make effective use of
memory.</p>

<p>6. Upon departure, a “rear-guard” comrade should thoroughly
check for any incriminating items. Have any papers
been left on the floor? Is there a telephone number scratched
on the wall? Has someone forgotten his coat, which might
contain Party data?</p>

<p>In one instance six weeks allegedly were spent in bringing
twenty people to a national underground conference.</p>

<p>If two comrades don’t know each other, advance arrangements
must be made, usually by notes, to effect identification
for a meeting. Here is one example. The note read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">On Friday, April 6, 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> at NE corner, Oak and 9th Sts.—my
courier will be standing with a <i>Field and Stream</i> magazine.
Bill’s courier will approach her and ask, “Mrs. Polk, what time
is it?” She will reply, “I’m sorry, my watch is stopped.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Note the use of a magazine and code words for identification.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
Just in case the first contact didn’t work out, there were alternative
instructions. The note continued:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">In case no one shows, she will be on the SW corner, Walnut
and 10th, same magazine, Friday, 13, 8 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>, same question
and answer. She will wait around only ten minutes each time.</p>

</div>

<p>Noncommunists probably will find it difficult to understand
the reckless abandon, personal risk, and sheer physical endurance
displayed by communists to conceal their underground
activities. Here are a few of the tactics employed by communists
to determine if they are being followed:</p>

<p class="tb"><i>Driving cars</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Driving alternately at high and low rates of speed.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Entering a heavily traveled intersection on a yellow
light, hoping to lose any follower or cause an accident.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Turning corners at high rates of speed and stopping
abruptly.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Suddenly leaving a car and walking hurriedly down a
one-way street in the direction in which vehicle traffic
is prohibited.</p>

<p class="hanging">5. Entering a dark street in a residential area at night,
making a sharp U-turn, cutting into a side alley, and
extinguishing the car’s lights.</p>

<p class="hanging">6. Driving to a rural area, taking a long walk in a field,
then having another car meet them.</p>

<p class="hanging">7. Waiting until the last minute, then making a sharp
left turn in front of oncoming traffic.</p>

<p class="hanging">8. Stopping at every filling station on the highway, walking
around the car, always looking, then going on.</p>

</div>

<p class="tb"><i>On foot</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Leaving subways, buses, and trains at the last minute,
even holding the door open and jumping off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p class="hanging">2. Entering hotels, bus terminals, and department stores
where there are many exits.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Stooping over in the aisles, then suddenly rising and
looking around to see if anybody is searching for
them.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Doubling back after rounding a corner.</p>

<p class="hanging">5. Putting a coin in a pay telephone booth, dialing a
number, then rushing to the adjoining booth to see if
anybody is trying to listen.</p>

<p class="hanging">6. Leaving a taxicab, but instructing the driver to go
around the block and pick them up again.</p>

<p class="hanging">7. Using store windows as mirrors to see behind them.</p>

<p class="hanging">8. Walking slowly to a corner, then starting to run down
an alleyway.</p>

</div>

<p class="tb">Always there is the fear of being followed. One Party
couple registered at a motel, then the husband parked the car
several miles away. He walked back and climbed through a
side window. Maybe in this way he could conceal his night’s
lodging!</p>

<p>A woman in a Midwestern city kept riding streetcars, buses,
and taxis for thirty hours, stopping at no time except for
meals. In communist language she was “<i>dry-cleaning</i>”; that
is, making certain that she was not being followed.</p>

<p>The pressure becomes terrific. As long as a comrade feels
he is “dirty” (that is, he suspects the “enemy,” meaning the
FBI, is near), he must keep up his “dry-cleaning.” He can
make his “meet” or enter a hide-out only when he’s certain he
is “clean.”</p>

<p>Two dry-cleaning techniques are of special interest. One is
the <i>switch-point</i> operation: The communist leader is driven to
a certain location in a car (called a “drop car”). There he
alights and enters another car (called a “pickup car”). Before
entering the second car, however, he will walk across a parking
lot, over a bridge, or through a department store—the object
being to lose any pursuer. In the double switch, the pickup
car drops the Party leader at a second switch, where he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
will be picked up by a third vehicle and then taken to his
destination.</p>

<p>In the <i>scramble</i>, members (as on leaving meetings) enter
automobiles. The drivers start the motors. Suddenly the doors
of the cars will open and the comrades will get out, including
the drivers. They scramble, meaning they quickly take seats
in the other cars, whereupon all autos will move away in different
directions. It’s hard for any “pursuer” to tell who went
in which car.</p>

<p>The underground creates intense strains on family life. The
undeviating demands of the Party (its interests must come
first, regardless of personal consequences) leave deep scars.</p>

<p>For years many families are separated. On some occasions
a midnight contact or a few days of furlough are permitted.
Children grow up without seeing their fathers. In one instance
a child was stricken with polio. His underground father did
not leave his Party work to come to the child’s bedside.
Mothers are often hard pressed to give answers to the question,
“Where’s Daddy?” Some “explain” that Daddy is away
on a trip, in another town, or dead. One little boy, whose
father was gone, said: “I wish my father was in jail. Then I
could at least see him.”</p>

<p>Normal family relationships are disrupted. The Party may
promise financial assistance to the families of underground
comrades, but many times the support is miserly or does not
come at all. Heart-rending results ensue:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>During the past four years, Hank and I have been separated
most of the time [one Party wife wrote]. There has never been
any question about carrying out the decisions made, even when
Hazel [small daughter] and I were set adrift by the Party
with no financial provision and I had to go to my family so
that my infant could have food and a place to live. When
Hazel almost died from third-degree burns, Hank didn’t even
know about it since we had no way to communicate. I have
been cut off from my family completely. The furniture, clothes
and other things that we accumulated during our marriage
we’ll probably never see again. We have moved, and moved,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
and moved yet again ... dragging Hazel around from place
to place, carrying out decisions made, guarding our security
and that of others.</p>

</div>

<p>The total effect was demoralizing. The wife continues:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I can’t have an operation because it would mean six months
in a cast and on my stomach—and there is no one to take care
of Hazel .... I get overtired physically, and the past four years
of the kind of life we have led, with its many pressures of
loneliness, financial scrounging, security measures and the
sword of Damocles—that of being discovered—hanging over
my head, finally took its toll.</p>

</div>

<p>Despite this woman’s hardships the Party brought charges
that her husband had been seeing her without permission. The
utter fanaticism of Party discipline is shown by her reaction
toward the charges: “If in spite of all this the Board feels that
there has been a breach of discipline, then I am willing to
abide by any decision made and accept whatever control is
agreed upon.”</p>

<p>The underground, perhaps more than any other phase of
Party activity, brings out the fanaticism of communist discipline.
The member becomes so entranced with his mission
that his hardships, sufferings, and obstacles become challenges
to overcome, not reasons for discouragement. The very
thought of working on this assignment, as one Party leader
stated, should make him “ooh and ah.”</p>

<p>Some Party wives, however, did not always “ooh and ah,”
but bitterly resented their husbands’ long absences from home
and the disruption of family life. This presented the Party
with a serious problem. These wives were potential weak links
in communist security; they might jeopardize the husbands’
location by making unauthorized contacts, might give information
to the “enemy” or impair morale by their uncongenial attitude.
One Party instruction, for example, urged that wives
should be spoken to and the importance of the Party’s policies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
explained. They must be indoctrinated more. For some Party
wives it would certainly take a lot of explaining.</p>

<p>Children have been born in the communist underground,
children who were not even given their true family names. In
one instance a father and mother living as an underground
couple (<i>transformed couple</i>) entered their child at a nearby
school under the family alias. In another case a baby born to
underground parents was registered with county authorities
under the underground alias. Imagine the hypocrisy of such a
family situation. A whole world of falsehoods must be invented
to satisfy youthful curiosity. What about the parents’
childhoods? What about grandparents? Every family matter
discussed must be carefully weighed: Will it give away any
secrets?</p>

<p>The very character of the underground, with its emphasis
on stealth and deceit, degrades human values. While many
comrades struggle in poverty, living in squalid conditions at
great personal sacrifice, a few enjoy the very best—comfortable
hide-outs equipped with all conveniences. For them the
underground is a “good life,” with others paying the bill.
Moreover, Party discipline often places great power into the
hands of some who, as petty dictators, do not hesitate to use
it to inflict revenge and spite on their personal enemies. Many
times the underground becomes a catacomb of back-stabbing
and the settling of old scores.</p>

<p>Sexual immorality is also abetted. In one instance an organizer,
leaving his wife and children, lived in Chicago with another
woman. In an Eastern city, a woman whose husband
was underground carried on an affair with another man. In
still another instance a wife kept company with a man while
her husband was forbidden by the Party’s underground leaders
to see her.</p>

<p>This is the communist underground. It may appear as a
“beehive of crazy confusion.” But it is not. All these shifts,
midnight meetings, and escape routes find meaning in only
one thing: the strengthening of the Party. The cardinal question
always is, “What is best for the Party?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span></p>

<p>As one Party leader stated, “Our best people are in this
field.... They are not in it for adventure, romance, thrills or
pleasure....” They “are in it because that is where the Party
wants them for political reasons....” “... it is ... probably
one of the toughest and hardest assignments for anyone.”</p>

<p>That is why the Party, as we have seen, tries desperately to
create the communist man, the individual obedient even when
he is beyond the Party’s immediate control. “It’s not me who
speaks,” one leader said, “but the Party.” Any allegiance outside
the Party must be broken. The underground worker is the
member who, even if cut off from leadership, will know what
to do, will carry out the assignment, regardless of what it is.
He is the man on whom all revolutionary plans depend.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how this fanaticism works:</p>

<p class="tb">Shortly before noon one day a top Party official drove east
out of town. At the outskirts he doubled back, twice turning
corners and coming to abrupt stops. Then, at speeds varying
from forty to eighty miles an hour, he continued east for
twenty-six miles. Turning around, he retraced his route at
eighty miles an hour.</p>

<p>He was “dry-cleaning” in a most dangerous and reckless
fashion. Back in town, for three hours he parked and reparked
his car, darting up streets, entering and immediately leaving
hotels.</p>

<p>At roughly 4:00 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> he left town again, this time driving
south, again at various speeds. After five hours he cut east for
fourteen miles, north for two, doubled back for twelve, south-east
for forty-two, sometimes running without his lights; parking
for a few minutes near buildings, then darting out at savage
speed.</p>

<p>Late that night, after roughly twelve hours of furtive, reckless
driving, often at highly dangerous speeds, he arrived at
his destination and checked into a hotel. He had covered some
360 miles; the normal driving distance was 195.</p>

<p>This type of fanatical communist, if so instructed, would
not hesitate to lead a riot, steal vital military secrets, sabotage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
defense industries, or perform illegal activities. Here is the
true communist at work, without concern for personal risk or
safety.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter box2b">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_21">21.<br>
<i>Espionage and Sabotage</i></h3>

</div>

<p>The communist underground is designed to carry forward
phases of the Party’s program which cannot be conducted
openly and lawfully. In addition, it contains weapons of attack
which must always remain hidden (the permanent part of the
underground), such as aid to Soviet espionage, attempts to
place members in strategic positions in industry for potential
sabotage, techniques to discredit law enforcement, and endeavors
to infiltrate the armed forces.</p>

<p>Lenin taught that the enemy must be weakened in advance.
To wait for something to happen is not the way to achieve
revolution. The way must be prepared. The enemy must be
softened up: weaken his will to resist, nullify his capacity for
counteraction, impair his morale. Then, as in November, 1917,
in Russia, when the crisis comes, communists can march to
power through the ranks of a demoralized enemy.</p>

<p>The Party’s relation to Soviet espionage is one of the most
potent weapons in the communist underground arsenal. As
past events have proven—for instance the Harry Gold-Klaus
Fuchs combination and the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg,
executed in 1953 on espionage charges—Moscow-directed
spying represents a vital danger to the integrity and
safety of free government. Espionage is utilized not only to
secure information but also to weaken the “enemy” from
within.</p>

<p>The Soviets very early instituted espionage operations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
against the United States with the full cooperation of the
Communist Party. In 1919 the Comintern was established
and, as we have seen in Chapter 4, Comintern “reps” became
common figures in Party circles. In January, 1919, Ludwig
C. A. K. Martens, a member of the Russian Communist Party,
was appointed as the first Soviet representative to the United
States. Although never recognized by the American government,
he set up an office in New York City. Arthur Adams,
later identified as a Soviet atom spy, was a member of Martens’
staff.</p>

<p>In the light of today’s well-organized, efficiently operated
spy apparatus, the Soviets in the early days were crude and
clumsy. Many of the Russians were not proficient in English.
They lacked knowledge of our customs and possessed no special
espionage training. Many were propaganda as well as
espionage agents and could be identified by their rabid
preaching of communism. Often the security of their communications
was not of the best.</p>

<p>In late July, 1920, a seaman on the SS <i>Stockholm</i> walked
up Pier 95 in New York City. Noticing customs officials
searching two other seamen, he turned and ran down the pier.
Later, after the seaman’s apprehension, a package was found
concealed in his trousers. Inside was a series of envelopes, one
inside the other with the smallest containing over 200 uncut
diamonds valued at 50,000 dollars. The smuggling of diamonds
was one of the early Bolshevik techniques of financing
operations in the United States. For whom was the package
destined? Inside was a typewritten letter starting, “Comrade
Martens.”</p>

<p>Unfamiliarity with America made dependence on the Communist
Party, USA, more important than ever. Without the
ready base of the Communist Party, USA, with its fanatical
allegiance to Moscow, Soviet espionage would have had tremendous
problems in getting started. As it was, there were
Party members available, able and willing to carry out Soviet
instructions. Often it was difficult to distinguish between a
member’s work for the Party and for Moscow. Comrades traveled
back and forth to Russia, were given assignments by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
Kremlin, and felt it their highest duty to gather information
for the Bolsheviks.</p>

<p>Party officials made assistance to Moscow priority Number
One. We have seen in Chapter 4 how the communist leadership,
for example, promised to help Comrade Loaf (a Comintern
agent) collect information on the American labor movement.
In another instance the Party Secretariat actually approved
the release of a Party member for Soviet intelligence
duties.</p>

<p>What were some of the ways through which the Communist
Party, USA, rendered aid to Soviet espionage?</p>

<p>Most important, of course, was recruitment. The Party was
able, time after time, to supply recruits, both members and
sympathizers, for espionage use. Suppose the Soviets needed
a photographer? a source of information in a Pennsylvania
steel plant? a trusted short-wave radio expert? The Party
would be expected to, and did, “fill the bill.”</p>

<p>This funneling of talent to the Soviets was often accomplished
through a special Party contact who was called a
“steerer.” A trusted old-time member, he was able to spot
recruits for espionage among the Party’s ranks and to fulfill
requests made by the Soviets. As espionage operations became
more complex, the “steerer’s” role became ever more vital.
The Party was a vast recruiting ground for spy talent.</p>

<p>The Party provided many essential “services” to Soviet
espionage. Suppose a Russian espionage agent secretly entered
the United States, to operate here or while en route to another
country. Most likely, as so often happened, he would need a
“new identity,” or, in espionage language, a “change of
feathers.” This probably meant a faked birth certificate, a
false passport, and other identification papers. Maybe he
would be placed in “deep freeze” for several months. If so, he
had to be “serviced”—that is, fed and clothed. After being “re-feathered,”
he would be on his way.</p>

<p>Then there were “business covers.” A Party member, perhaps
with Soviet funds, would set up a business, allegedly for
legitimate purposes but actually for espionage. In 1927,
World Tourists was incorporated in New York, ostensibly for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
tourist business. Actually, this “business,” under the operation
of Jacob Golos, a communist “steerer,” became an active espionage
“cover.”</p>

<p>The Party, in addition, helped arrange the transfer of funds,
established mail drops (where espionage communications
come to a third person, later to be given to the espionage network),
and operated couriers. In one instance a Party member
even served as an interpreter for a Soviet agent.</p>

<p>Even from these early days, however, evidence existed that
the Soviets were aware of the dangers of too close an affiliation
with the United States Party. An espionage operation might
be jeopardized by a known Party member’s participation.
Similarly, in the event of a “blow-up,” the Party, in the public’s
eyes, would be linked directly with a foreign power,
Soviet Russia. This was one thing both the Soviets and Party
officials wanted to avoid. Hence, by the early 1940’s there was
a definite lessening of direct Soviet dependence on the U.S.
Party for espionage assistance.</p>

<p>The Soviet spy system, moreover, was now better able to
stand on its own feet. In 1924, Amtorg Trading Corporation
(a Soviet government commercial agency) was established.
This gave the Soviets their first “legal” base for espionage operations.
In this way persons or institutions in a country openly
as representatives or agents of a foreign power have an
ideal cover to fulfill their assignments of clandestine espionage.
In 1933 diplomatic recognition was afforded the Soviet Union.
Now trained espionage agents, operating under diplomatic
immunity, could direct operations. After World War II Russians
assigned to the United Nations in this country gave additional
striking power to Soviet espionage. Moreover, assistance
was possible through the espionage networks of Soviet
satellite countries operating in the United States.</p>

<p>This lessening of direct Soviet dependence on the Party was
a gradual development. Whereas in the early 1920’s Party and
espionage work were often indistinguishable, the Soviets now
instructed members tapped for service to drop all connections
with the Party. One old-time Party member, turned spy, told
the FBI that the Soviets had instructed agents to conceal their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
Party affiliations. This soon became a standard technique. If
engaged in espionage, cut off all connections with the Party,
even contacts with former Party friends. Ethel Rosenberg, for
example, indicated that she no longer bought the <i>Daily
Worker</i> at her usual newsstand. Another agent, while in the
company of a Soviet superior, stopped to purchase a communist
publication. He was severely reprimanded. The communist
label might betray the espionage ring.</p>

<p>The Soviets, however, still depended on communists or
sympathizers for assistance. In one major apparatus detected
by the FBI, for example, twelve of seventeen participants had
been Party members. Both Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, executed
as Soviet spies, had communist backgrounds.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Bentley, moreover, has given testimony as to how
she collected dues from secret members of the Party when she
came to Washington as a courier of the Soviet espionage system.
Among those from whom she has stated she collected
dues were officials of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS),
Department of Commerce, the Air Corps, the Office of the
Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, the Treasury Department,
and others. In some instances one person would collect
dues for a group and hand them over to Miss Bentley. One
such individual was Nathan Gregory Silvermaster, who, according
to Miss Bentley, headed a group. (Silvermaster denied
the disclosures initially and later invoked the Fifth
Amendment.) On occasions a member of a group when coming
to New York would deliver the Party dues collected to
Miss Bentley there. The Party also benefited, as disclosed by
testimony, because, as in some instances, information collected
for the Soviets was made available to the leadership of the
Party for review.</p>

<p>In 1945 the defection of Igor Gouzenko, cipher clerk assigned
to the Soviet Embassy in Canada, revealed close tie-ups
between Soviet espionage and Canadian communists.
Then the appearance of FBI informants at Smith Act trials
shocked the Soviet Union as to the amazing extent to which
the FBI had penetrated the Communist Party, USA. These,
among other revelations, encouraged even more the Soviet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
tendency to lessen its direct dependence on the Party. Today,
with some exceptions, the Soviets are attempting to operate
their espionage networks independent of the Party, staying
away, as much as possible, from Party assistance. This does
not mean, however, that the Party is today not playing an important
role in Soviet espionage. As we shall see, the Party is
doing much to prepare the way for Soviet espionage and,
when the need arises, will unhesitatingly supply vital assistance.
The present “drawing away” from direct Party assistance
is strictly a Soviet tactical maneuver, subject to instant change.</p>

<p>Soviet espionage is no longer a clumsy, crude affair, as it
was in the days of the rollicking “reps,” but a deadly efficient
profession, skillfully directed from Moscow, with well-trained
agents supplied with money, modern technical equipment,
and experience. To the Soviets, espionage is a part of over-all
state policy.</p>

<p>On an April night in 1951, just two minutes before seven
o’clock, a tall man wearing a tweed sport coat walked through
the darkness toward the Washington Monument in our nation’s
capital. Brilliant lights played on the famous shrine. The
usually bustling place was deserted. Everything was quiet.</p>

<p>Suddenly the tall man stepped from the circle of darkness
into the light. He stopped a moment, peered up at the 555-foot
top, looked at his watch, then started to walk around the base.
On his left hand he wore a glove. A band of adhesive tape
circled the middle finger of his right hand, and he carried a
red-covered book under his left arm. This man was an employee
of our Defense Department. As part of his work he
had access to highly confidential information, just what the
Russians wanted.</p>

<p>Exactly at seven o’clock, another man clad in a dark business
suit stepped from the shadows. An espionage contact set
up months previously in Austria was being consummated to
the minute. The second man was Yuri V. Novikov, Second
Secretary of the Soviet Embassy in Washington. (Novikov
was well known to the FBI, since his activities in the United
States had gone far beyond those of a diplomatic official. He
was audacious almost beyond description. His brazenness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
reached a climax when he sat with defense counsel during the
espionage trial of the onetime Justice Department employee,
Judith Coplon. During this trial he would write out questions
and hand them to defense counsel to direct to FBI agents on
the witness stand. He was particularly interested in having
questions asked pertaining to our internal administration and
procedures.)</p>

<p>When Novikov met the government employee he said, “I’m
Mr. Williams,” the code words of recognition, along with the
glove, tape, and red book. The two shook hands, then Novikov
took the military specialist by the elbow, directing him from
the light. A few words, arranging another meeting, and they
parted.</p>

<p>From that night, for an entire year, the Soviets made secretive
contacts with the government employee, never realizing
that he was a “double agent” of the FBI. Seldom were meetings
held in the same place. Some were on lonely lanes or in
dead-end streets; one on a narrow rock bridge on a deserted
Maryland road after dark. One time Novikov stood in a movie
line; the double agent was to pass by and, seeing him there,
would know that a meeting was scheduled one hour later at a
nearby school. Then there were chalk marks on trash cans and
a pencil mark on page 100 of the Manhattan (New York)
telephone directory in Washington’s Union Station, elaborate
code signals between Novikov and the man from the defense
establishment.</p>

<p>I hasten to add that the government employee was a loyal
American, and in meeting Novikov he was merely carrying out
a duty imposed upon him when he was assigned in Austria
with the air force. His services were solicited by Otto Verber,
who came to the United States as a refugee, as did Kurt L.
Ponger, who had married Verber’s sister. Both Verber and
Ponger were in the armed services, both had acquired American
citizenship, and, after the war, both had served in Europe.
Upon returning to private life, both settled in Vienna, where
they took advantage of the GI bill and benefits and enrolled
in the University of Vienna. In 1949 Ponger was recruited by
the Soviet intelligence service, and he in turn recruited Verber.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
It was later learned that Ponger had been a member of a
Communist Party cell in England before he came to the
United States as a refugee. He also had indoctrinated Verber.</p>

<p>The air force representative promptly reported Verber’s approach
to his superiors and from that time on acted under
instructions. Prior to his return to the United States, Verber
and Ponger arranged for the meeting at the Washington
Monument. The Treasury of the United States, of course, received
the thousands of dollars of Soviet funds paid to the
loyal American.</p>

<p>In June, 1953, after pleading guilty to an espionage indictment,
Ponger was sentenced to a prison term of from five to
fifteen years, while Verber received a sentence of from three
years, four months, to ten years. Novikov, who was named in
the indictment as a co-conspirator, was declared <i>persona non
grata</i> and returned to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>The Soviet spy system is a disciplined structure, composed
of many networks. There are the “legal” networks; that is, espionage
controlled by legal representatives of the Russian
government, such as diplomats. This was the case of Novikov.
Then there are illegal networks, meaning spy rings operated
by Moscow independent of the legal establishments. More
and more the Soviets are concentrating on building illegal networks
and planting “sleeper” agents. Such was the case of
Colonel Rudolf Ivanovich Abel, of Soviet intelligence, who
was arrested by the Immigration and Naturalization Service
in June, 1957, at the request of the FBI, after we had identified
him as a concealed agent. After his indictment in August,
1957, on espionage charges, information was made public concerning
him which the FBI could not previously disclose. In
November, 1957, after being convicted in Federal Court,
Eastern District of New York, he was sentenced to thirty years
in prison and fined 3000 dollars. Subsequently, a notice of
appeal was filed.</p>

<p>Ordinarily a network includes a principal (the boss), always
a Russian national in a “legal” network. Then there are,
depending on the size of the network, group leaders, couriers,
sources of information. Non-Russians, such as Harry Gold, may<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
reach as high as a group leader or may be even a principal,
but at all times they are under the firm control of Soviet superiors.
In espionage, as in all features of communism, native
comrades exist only to serve the Russian master.</p>

<p>Strange as it may sound, it is difficult to become a Russian
espionage agent. The Soviets are highly selective. They will
not accept just anybody. Does the prospect have access to confidential
data? Will he accept discipline? What is his background?
The Russians want to know everything about him.
Sometimes elaborate verification checks, from Soviet contacts
around the world, are run. Moreover, the breaking-in period
of a prospect may be very slow. At first he may be given minor
assignments to test his flair for intelligence work and discernment
of details, all without risk to any established espionage
operation. If he “comes through,” he’ll be given more responsible
work.</p>

<p>Why does an individual engage in espionage? Why do native
Americans betray their country for a foreign tyranny?</p>

<p>The motives are many, and often intertwined: money, the
temporary thrill of secretive work, personal weaknesses, blackmail,
feelings of spite against America because of an imagined
wrong, a hope to assist relatives in communist countries. Very
important, however, is ideological motivation, an attraction to
the theory of communism and/or misguided admiration for
Soviet rule in Russia.</p>

<p>Let’s examine more closely this ideological motivation since
it is playing such a major role today. We can distinguish two
major categories:</p>

<p class="tb">1. <i>Non-Party ideological motivation</i>: that is, a feeling for
or acceptance of the alleged principles of communism. In
prior years many thousands were hoodwinked into believing,
because of propaganda, that Russia represented a new “era”
in humanity, that anti-Semitism was being abolished, that injustices
were being rectified, that the problems of hunger,
poverty, and racial discrimination were being solved. Among
the reasons Harry Gold, who was never a Party member, gave
for entering Russian espionage were:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">A genuine desire to help the people of the Soviet Union to be
able to enjoy some of the better things of life.... Here, too,
in the person of the Soviet Union was the one bulwark against
the further encroachment of that monstrosity, Fascism....
Anything that was against anti-Semitism I was for, and so the
chance to help strengthen the Soviet Union seemed like a wonderful
opportunity.</p>

</div>

<p class="tb">2. <i>Party ideological motivation</i>: the conditioning of thousands
of members and sympathizers in the tenets of Marxism-Leninism,
schooling them in loyalty to Moscow. Every Party
member, through his training, is a potential communist espionage
or sabotage agent. Julius Rosenberg, a fanatical Party
member, actually volunteered his services. David Greenglass,
Rosenberg’s brother-in-law, was also an ardent communist.
Walking along Highway 66 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in
1944, his wife, Ruth, who had just come from New York City,
told David that Julius wanted him to furnish information
about his work at Los Alamos, where the atom bomb was being
prepared. (David was assigned there as an army technician.)
At first David said no—but his ideological motivation
as a communist reversed his decision, and he agreed. He was
to do great damage to America by furnishing the Russians,
through Rosenberg, with valuable information about our
greatest weapon.</p>

<p>Then there are other methods of motivating agents:</p>

<p class="tb">1. <i>Threat of exposure and blackmail.</i> Agents are given
money (sometimes even against their will). Usually the
amount is small, but a receipt is obtained, thus compromising
their independence. Or they are made to sign papers, reports,
or documents. If the initial ideological enthusiasm wears off,
as it probably will, the agent is trapped. Even if he so desires,
he cannot break away.</p>

<p class="tb">2. <i>Use of hostages.</i> Once they have control over relatives
and loved ones the Soviets do not hesitate to let it be known<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
that unless their victim does their bidding a whole family will
be liquidated.</p>

<p class="tb">Today the Party, with its thousands of members, represents
a vast reservoir of potential espionage agents. Moreover, its
vast propaganda and ideological program is daily saturating
their hearts, minds, and souls with a sympathetic acceptance
of communism. To be a Party member does not automatically
mean being an espionage agent, but it makes the member
potential spy material, if the request for aid to Russia ever
comes. This is a tremendous and present danger to our
security.</p>

<p>The United States is strategic spy target Number One for
the Soviets. Every effort is being made to penetrate our defenses.
The Soviets are interested in literally everything. Any
person who believes that espionage means securing only military
information is unacquainted with the nature of twentieth-century
spying. An army manual, security regulations of a
government building, the “political” views of a clerk in an
industrial firm, incidents in the life of a prominent person
which might be used for blackmail—these and many more are
prize espionage targets. Soviet espionage is both mass (seeking
information at random) and specific (trying to obtain a
certain blueprint or military operational plan); open (gathering
public source items, such as newspapers, magazines, maps,
navigational charts, patents, aerial photographs, technical journals)
and undercover (use of illegal means to steal information).</p>

<p>Here are some major “areas of interest” of Soviet espionage
in the United States:</p>

<p class="tb">1. Scientific research and development, with particular attention
to atomic energy, missiles, radar defense, electronics,
and aeronautics.</p>

<p>2. The strength, deployment, training methods, strategy,
and tactics of the armed forces of the United States, together
with ordnance, weapons, and military equipment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>3. The intelligence and counterintelligence agencies of the
United States, possibilities for penetration.</p>

<p>4. International relations of the United States.</p>

<p>5. Weaknesses in American public and private life that can
be exploited for intelligence and propaganda purposes.</p>

<p>6. Anti-Soviet political opposition groups, refugees from
the Soviet Union and satellite countries, and nationality
groups in the United States.</p>

<p class="tb">The world of Soviet espionage, like the communist underground,
is bleak and dreary. An individual may work for years
and know his superior only as “Bill” or “Henry.” His rewards:
a smile, a promise, or a token award. Harry Gold, who gave a
lifetime to the Soviets, was awarded the Order of the Red
Star, which, among other things, gave him the privilege of
free trolley rides in Moscow. To those hoping to get money,
the promise is always big, but results are meager. Here are
Gold’s own words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... the difficulty in raising money for ... trips; the weary
hours of waiting on street corners in strange towns where I
had no business to be and the killing of time in cheap movies;
and the lies I had to tell at home and to my friends to explain
my supposed whereabouts (Mom was certain that I was carrying
on a series of clandestine love affairs).... It was
drudgery ... anyone who had an idea this work was glamorous
and exciting was very wrong indeed—nothing could have
been more dreary.</p>

</div>

<p>Life is disciplined to the final detail. The individual is a
cog in a vast, inhuman, demanding machine. Klaus Fuchs, for
example, while committing espionage in New York, asked
permission from the Soviets for his sister in Massachusetts to
stay with him. A petty detail but, disciplined agent that he
was, he got the necessary approval.</p>

<p>The pressure is terrific, with the Soviet principals always
wanting more and more. “If you were in Russia,” one Soviet
superior barked at a sub-agent who had done something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
wrong, “you would suffer the same fate as the traitors in the
Moscow trials,” referring to the purges of the 1930’s. Everything
is geared to promote Russian interests. If the agent fails,
there are threats of dire consequences.</p>

<p>Espionage’s twin partner is sabotage. In 1917 and after,
sabotage played an important part in the Bolshevik rise to
power. Revolution for the communists is a “science,” of which
sabotage is an important element. Not to use it, according to
communist tactics, is to hinder victory.</p>

<p>The Communist Party, USA, has not reached the point
where preparations for sabotage are vital to its future plans.
Its small numbers, fear of FBI penetration of its inner discussions,
and the existence of federal laws against sabotage and
insurrection militate against such plans. So far the communists
have carefully refrained from any show of terrorism. Any such
act, even random sorties, the communists realize, would cause
more harm to the Party by counter prosecutive action than
any damage achieved by violence. Moreover, basic communist
revolutionary tactics dictate against any such sabotage attempts
until the eve of hostilities, which we pray and hope
will never come. According to communist teaching, the comrades
should not “tip their hands” until the “time is ripe.” At
a time when the Party was more open and truthful in proclaiming
its objectives and tactics, Party organizers were instructed,
“To raise the slogan of an armed demonstration without
any anticipation of a speedy transformation into an armed
revolt, and before the preconditions for a successful revolt
exist, is to be guilty of playing with revolution.”</p>

<p>Never must we forget, however, that even though acts of
sabotage are not now part of the Party’s program, they may
become so in the future. In fact, the communist underground
provides a cover to commit sabotage when it will serve the
communist cause.</p>

<p>As part of the Party’s underground the communists are
pursuing a program called <i>colonization</i>, designed to place
concealed members in strategic positions in basic industries
and defense facilities. Colonization is part of the Party’s industrial
concentration program, which aims at increasing communist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
influence in industry and labor. This always has a high
Party priority. Basic industry is a commonly used Party term,
which one communist manual has defined as those industries
“upon which the whole economic system depends.” Hence to
have a Party member in a steel plant would be more advantageous
to the communists than one in a corncob-pipe factory.
This technique is also often called “A Party Rooted Among
the Workers.”</p>

<p>In event of an emergency these colonizers, because of their
key positions and concealed capacities, would be able to commit
sabotage. A trained communist, by a flip of a switch, the
pull of a lever, or the release of death-generating germs, could
disrupt the work of thousands. One publication described the
Party’s objective:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">In order to overthrow the capitalist system, the working class
must control the key positions in the capitalist system. These
are not the state and federal capitals, public buildings, or residential
neighborhoods, but the heart of the capitalist system—the
shops, mines, mills and factories.</p>

</div>

<p>Moreover, the location of communist members in key industrial
facilities places the Party in a position, if it desires, to
promote strikes and slowdowns, which can be used as forms
of sabotage. These tactics are vital, in communist thinking, to
create “revolutionary situations” preparatory to the seizure of
power.</p>

<p>Colonizers do not participate in open Party activities. Often
they come from other areas of the country, even giving up
their chosen professions. Sometimes a man and wife (a colonizer
couple) will be sent into this phase of underground operations.
The emphasis is on young people—those in their
twenties and thirties. Operating under aliases, they attempt to
work their way into more strategic industrial positions. These
colonizers represent a deadly communist underground weapon.
They are “sleepers” who, upon Party instructions, may one
day rise up against our nation.</p>

<p>Another potential danger arises from previous sabotage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
training of Party members. Some, as we have seen, attended
Moscow’s Lenin School. There they learned, among other
things, the techniques of guerrilla warfare, how to make sabotage
devices and organize civilian resistance. Others served in
the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. According
to William Z. Foster, 15,000 Party members saw duty
with American military forces during World War II. The
Party realizes that the enrollment of members in the armed
forces provides military experience which, in a time of revolutionary
crisis, could be utilized to communist advantage—at
“capitalist” expense.</p>

<p>All the time, while the Party is attacking free government,
both above-ground and underground, it seeks complete license
to pursue its schemes. Any opposition by the government is
labeled “persecution,” “Red baiting,” or “thought control.”</p>

<p>For this reason communists grasp every opportunity to discredit,
weaken, and vilify the institutions enforcing law and
order. As long as the American judicial system is strong and
realistically recognizes the threat of subversion to our constitutional
republic, their efforts will be hampered. They know
that.</p>

<p>Listen to these teachings. Are they calculated to instill respect
for our democratic heritage?</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—<i>The law-enforcement officer</i>: “... a servant of the boss class....
He is your enemy.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—<i>The courts</i>: “... the workers must ... recognize the capitalist
court as a class enemy—as a weapon in the bosses’ hands....”
“The worker must also understand that courts are not impartial....”</p>

</div>

<p>At all times communists are told to try to make “bourgeois”
courts look weak and silly. If members are brought to trial,
turn the courtroom into a sounding board for communism.
“... the aim should be to turn the trial into an open tribunal
for the spreading and propagating of Communist ideas and
aims.” “The class struggle goes on in the courtroom as well as
it does on the picket line, in the shops, and in the mines.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>That’s why every possible tactic is used inside the courtroom
to obstruct the orderly operation of justice. Outside, another
attack is coordinated: letter-writing campaigns, fund-raising
drives, propaganda leaflets, literature, all alleging that
the communists on trial are being “persecuted” and that
American courts are “unfair,” “partial,” and “undemocratic.”</p>

<p>Another weapon in the Party’s underground arsenal is the
attempted infiltration of our armed forces. “Illegal work is
particularly necessary in the army, the navy and police,” Lenin
proclaimed. Another communist writer adds, “The capitalist
class has the army, navy and police at its disposal precisely
for the purpose of keeping the working class from seizing
power.”</p>

<p>Yet, in the final analysis, as the communists well know,
force and violence will be needed to bring about the revolution.</p>

<p>In fact this is exactly what Khrushchev had in mind when
he told the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party of
the Soviet Union:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">... Our enemies like to depict us Leninists as advocates of
violence always and everywhere. True, we recognize the need
for the revolutionary transformation of capitalist society into
socialist society. It is this that distinguishes the revolutionary
Marxists from the reformists, the opportunists. There is no
doubt that in a number of capitalist countries the violent overthrow
of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and the sharp aggravation
of class struggle connected with this are inevitable....</p>

</div>

<p>Over 100 years ago Marx and Engels made this point perfectly
clear in the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>. “The Communists
disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare
that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow
of all existing social conditions.” Lenin was more pointed:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">As long as capitalism and socialism exist, we cannot live in
peace: in the end, one or the other will triumph—a funeral
dirge will be sung either over the Soviet Republic or over
world capitalism.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span></p>

<p>Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev reveals his own hypocrisy
when, in the same breath, he boasts that the communist
world has no aggressive intentions and then declares as he did
in August, 1957, “We are Leninists and are for peaceful cooperation.”
Through the use of Aesopian language he is seeking
to induce the Western world to relax its guard until the
time when the communist world is ready to launch its offensive
and hopes to chant the “funeral dirge” over the free
world.</p>

<p>How can loyal Americans resist this attack? I turn to this
subject in the concluding chapters.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter box2b">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_22">22.<br>
<i>What Can You Do?</i></h3>

</div>

<p>The responsible person who gains an understanding of
communism knows that such understanding should lead to
the question: “But what can I do about it?”</p>

<p>My answer is that we can do <i>a lot</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">1. First and most important is to make sure that we do not
permit the communists to fool us into becoming “innocent victims.”
Our defense? First, to know the answers to the “Five
False Claims of Communism” given in Chapter 7. Next, to
know the ways to “spot” deceptive communist fronts, listed at
the end of Chapter 17.</p>

<p class="tb">2. Members of a trade union or any civic, fraternal, or social
organization can help by spotting, exposing, and opposing
communist efforts to infiltrate and capture that organization.
How this can be done is told in Chapter 16.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p class="tb">3. And, finally, there may well be occasions when everyone
might have the opportunity to help expose and prevent attempts
at espionage, sabotage, and other types of subversive
activity.</p>

<p>“Yes,” one might say, “but I’m just a private citizen. Isn’t
spy-hunting a job for the FBI?”</p>

<p>Of course it is a job for the FBI, one given it by Presidential
directives, acts of Congress, and rulings of the Attorney General.
But the FBI can’t do it all alone. The FBI has jurisdiction
over more than 140 violations of federal law, and in a
country with over 170,000,000 inhabitants there are fewer
than 6200 agents of the FBI. Hence, all of these agents are
not available for the investigation of subversive activities. We
need the help of <i>all</i> loyal Americans.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in a democracy like ours, citizenship carries
with it not only <i>rights</i> but <i>obligations</i>. One of these is to do
<i>our</i> part to preserve, protect, and defend the United States
against all enemies, whether domestic or foreign. The President
of the United States, for example, in issuing directives
giving the FBI the responsibility over matters relating to espionage,
sabotage, and subversive activities, specifically called
upon all patriotic citizens and individuals to assist us.</p>

<p>Therefore, those individuals who place information they
have regarding the communist conspiracy into the proper
hands are making a contribution of great value to the security
of their country.</p>

<p>“But,” one may say, “what can I do? I lead an ordinary life.
I don’t know any communists. So how can I be of any help?”</p>

<p>My answer to that is: You never know! Here is a case history
of another average American who thought he “didn’t
know any communists.”</p>

<p>This incident might be called the Case of the Forgotten
Rubbish.</p>

<p>It was on a Saturday. A man telephoned one of our field
offices. “I’ve been cleaning out my garage,” he said, “and I’ve
found some old rubbish there.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the special agent.</p>

<p>“I guess I’m crazy calling about this, but I thought you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
might be interested. The stuff doesn’t belong to me. It was
left here by some roomers who moved a month or two ago.
There’s a box with a lot of cards.”</p>

<p>“What kind of cards?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” the man answered. “I never saw any like
them before. There are no names on them. Have words like
‘club’ and ‘section’ and some different colored tabs on them.
Guess I should have burned them and not....”</p>

<p>“We’re certainly glad you called,” the agent said. “Mind if
we come to see you?”</p>

<p>That telephone call enabled the FBI to secure the membership
records of a complete section of the Communist Party.
Marked for destruction by the section membership secretary,
they had, by mistake, found their way into the forgotten rubbish.</p>

<p>Now an alert, patriotic citizen had placed these records into
the fight against communism, helping to identify many of the
most dangerous subversives in his very own community.</p>

<p>In this way he, like many others who report information to
the FBI, was helping protect his own home, family, and nation.</p>

<p>Don’t think one must have evidence establishing the identity
of a spy, the hide-out of an underground Party leader, or
the location of stolen blueprints before he can report information.
Many cases start with very small clues, a scrap of paper,
a photograph, an abandoned passport. Then, bit by bit,
the entire picture is developed by investigation.</p>

<p>Here are a few suggestions of what Americans can report
to the FBI:</p>

<p class="tb">1. Any information about espionage, sabotage, and subversive
activities. The FBI is as close to every person as the
nearest telephone. See the front of any telephone book for the
FBI’s number.</p>

<p class="tb">2. Don’t worry if the information seems incomplete or
trivial. Many times a small bit of information might furnish
the data we are seeking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p class="tb">3. Stick to the facts. The FBI is not interested in rumor or
idle gossip. Talebearing should always be avoided. The FBI
is not interested in what a person thinks but what he does to
undermine our national security.</p>

<p class="tb">4. Don’t try to do any investigating yourself. Security investigations
require great care and effort. The innocent must
be protected as well as the guilty identified. That is the job
for the professional investigator. Hysteria, witch hunts, and
vigilantes weaken our internal security.</p>

<p class="tb">5. Be alert. America’s best defense lies in the alertness of
its patriotic citizens.</p>

<p>As we have seen, identifying communists is not easy. They
are trained in deceit and trickery and use every form of
camouflage and dishonesty to advance their cause.</p>

<p>For this reason we must be absolutely certain that our
fight is waged with full regard for the historic liberties of this
great nation. <i>This is the fundamental premise of any attack
against communism.</i></p>

<p>Too often I have seen cases where loyal and patriotic but
misguided Americans have thought they were “fighting communism”
by slapping the label of “Red” or “communist”
on anybody who happened to be different from them or to
have ideas with which they did not agree.</p>

<p>Smears, character assassination, and the scattering of irresponsible
charges have no place in this nation. They create
division, suspicion, and distrust among loyal Americans—just
what the communists want—and hinder rather than aid the
fight against communism.</p>

<p>Another thing. Time after time in this book I have mentioned
that honest dissent should not be confused with disloyalty.
A man has a right to think as he wishes: that’s the
strength of our form of government. Without free thought
our society would decay. Just because a man’s opinion is
unpopular and represents a minority viewpoint or is different
he is not necessarily disloyal. Hence, one should have the
facts before accusing anyone of propagating the Party line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>One of the chief jobs of the FBI, fully as important as
tracking down spies, is to protect the civil rights of individuals.</p>

<p>In the FBI our objective in any investigation is to secure
the facts which will establish the truth or falsity of a complaint
or allegation. We do not evaluate nor do we make
recommendations for a course of action as to whether a man
should be prosecuted, hired, or removed from a job. The
FBI is strictly a fact-gathering agency, responsible, in turn,
to the Attorney General, the President, the Congress, and, in
the last analysis, to the American people. The investigative
and adjudicatory processes simply do not belong in the same
organization.</p>

<p>When the clouds of World War II began to lower, large
segments of our people became conscious for the first time
that America was confronted with an enemy from within.
One of the disgraces of our era is that it was ever necessary
to question the loyalty of Americans. The record, however, is
clear: There were some who, using the protective cloak of the
rights of all Americans as a cover, sought to conceal traitorous
and subversive activities.</p>

<p>In carrying out our responsibilities we soon became very
conscious of the fact that each allegation and complaint had
to be carefully checked. There are literally thousands of
people in this country who have been the target of accusation
and thousands whose loyalty could be established only by
investigation. Most have been grateful. Some have been
resentful that they were investigated at all; but we had a job
to do, and it was done with impartiality and a zealous regard
for the rights and reputation of the individuals involved. One
of the happiest moments in our day-to-day activities is when
we can establish the innocence of a man wrongfully accused.</p>

<p>Here are a few illustrations of the outcome of investigations
which have given us a feeling of satisfaction:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">A New York man changed his name to one that was more
pronounceable. He was with the Merchant Marine and the
accusation was made that he was a member of the Communist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
Party; that he had been educational director of a Party section
and had signed a Communist Party petition. We investigated.
We found that the man in changing his name had taken the
name of a Communist Party member who was an educational
director of a section of the Party in New York. Beyond that,
we secured handwriting specimens of the man with the
changed name, and our laboratory technicians established that
he had not signed the Party petition.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">A scientist was seeking a job with the army. The accusation
arose that he had signed a communist petition. We investigated
and found that a man with the same name and initial
had signed such a petition but he was not the scientist.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">A government agency received a letter bearing a fictitious signature
stating that a government employee was working with
the Communist Party. We investigated. Our inquiry revealed
that all comment concerning the employee was highly favorable,
except for the statement of a seventy-two-year-old woman
residing in Philadelphia who was a neighbor of the government
worker. This woman advised she had overheard the
employee say, “I’m working for the Communist Party” but admitted
the employee said she had made the statement in jest.
The neighbor said she had never written any agency of the
government concerning the employee. During the investigation
we secured specimens of the elderly neighbor’s handwriting
and determined she had written the defamatory letter
out of spite.</p>

<p class="stars">****</p>

<p class="noindent">An allegation was made that a former army officer was the
nephew of a French communist leader and maintained a close
relationship with him. Our investigation disclosed that the two
men had the same name, but were not related. The only contact
the army officer ever had with the French communist
leader was when he met the Frenchman on one occasion and
inquired as to his ancestry.</p>

</div>

<p>When a citizen thinks he has been wrongfully accused of
communist activity, we, as a matter of long-standing policy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
are more than happy to receive any statement he might care
to make. Then, if we receive a future allegation, his statement
will be on file and can be considered in connection with any
investigation we are called on to make.</p>

<p>As I have stated, time after time FBI investigations exonerate
the innocent. The latest scientific knowledge, finger-prints,
new investigative techniques, careful training of our
special agents in the mechanics and ethics of conducting good
investigations—all these represent the assurance that the FBI
is zealously protecting not only the internal security of the
nation but also the rights, life, and property of the individual.</p>

<p>There are some who feel that a national police agency
should be established to meet and handle all phases of the
communist menace, since under the present structure of
government many agencies have a responsibility for internal
security. This, they say, would cut through the “red tape,”
centralize all investigations and determinations, and make
for more “efficiency.” I disagree. This nation has no need
for a national police. Such an agency would be contrary to
American tradition. The present system of cooperation among
the nation’s law-enforcement agencies is completely adequate
to meet the needs. Weaknesses do exist. They lie not in the
system itself but in its implementation. These weaknesses can
be and are being overcome.</p>

<p>What can one do in the fight against communism?</p>

<p>I repeat: a lot. Always remember that this fight is something
which must be carried on soberly, seriously, and, above
all, <i>responsibly</i>. Our best weapons are facts and the truth.
“And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
free.” Don Whitehead in his book, <i>The FBI Story</i>, in concluding
his study of the FBI and its problems stated the case
most accurately when he said:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">The top command of the FBI have no illusions that communism
can be destroyed in the United States by the investigation,
prosecution and conviction of Communist Party leaders
who conspire to overthrow the government by force and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
violence. That is merely one phase of the job to be done in a
world-wide struggle.</p>

<p>The FBI knows that the bigger job lies with the free world’s
intellectuals—the philosophers, the thinkers wherever they may
be, the professors and scientists and scholars and students.
These people who think, the intellectuals if you please, are
the ones who can and must convince men that communism
is evil. The world’s intellectuals themselves must see that
communism is the deadliest enemy that intellectualism and
liberalism ever had. They must be as willing to dedicate
themselves to this cause as the Communists have been to
dedicate themselves to their cause.</p>

<i>Communism: A False Religion</i></h3>

</div>

<p>Something utterly new has taken root in America during
the past generation, a communist mentality representing a
systematic, purposive, and conscious attempt to destroy
Western civilization and roll history back to the age of barbaric
cruelty and despotism, all in the name of “progress.”
Evil is depicted as good, terror as justice, hate as love, and
obedience to a foreign master as patriotism.</p>

<p>Numerically speaking, this mentality is limited to a few
men and women, the disciplined corps of the Communist
Party, USA. However, communist thought control, in all its
various capacities, has spread the infection, in varying degrees,
to most phases of American life.</p>

<p>This mentality, imported to our land for the purpose of
eventually leading to a destruction of the American way of
life, poses a crucial problem for every one of us. It can destroy
our constitutional republic if it is permitted to corrupt our
minds and control our acts.</p>

<p>I have tried to make the tactics of the Communist Party
as clear as possible in this book. These tactics are part of
world-wide communism and are offered as bait to divert and
capture our minds.</p>

<p>In our tolerance for religious freedom, for separation of
church and state, we sometimes lose sight of the historical
fact: Western civilization has deep religious roots. Our
schools, courts, legislative bodies, social agencies, philanthropic
organizations as well as our churches are witnesses<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
to the fundamental fact that life has a significance that we
ourselves do not create.</p>

<p>It is part of our tradition and belief that each of us is
obligated to give, when reality requires it, a reason for the
faith that is in him. The presence of communism in the world
and in our own country is a kind of stern reality which should
make each of us explore our own faith as deeply as we can
and then speak up for its relationship to our “American
way.”</p>

<p>The very essence of our faith in democracy and our fellow
man is rooted in a belief in a Supreme Being. To my mind
there are six aspects to our democratic faith:</p>

<p class="tb">1. A belief in the dignity and worth of the individual, a
belief which today is under assault by the communist practice
which regards the individual as a part of the “class,” the
“mass,” and a pawn of the state;</p>

<p class="tb">2. A belief in mutual responsibility, of our obligation to
“feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and care for the less
fortunate,” which is affronted by communist policies of
calculated ruthlessness;</p>

<p class="tb">3. A belief that life has a meaning which transcends any
manmade system, that is independent of any such system,
and that outlasts any such system, a belief diametrically opposed
by the materialistic dogma of communism;</p>

<p class="tb">4. A belief in stewardship, a feeling that a great heritage
is our sacred trust for the generations yet to come, a belief
that stands today as the competitor to communist loyalty to
Marxism-Leninism;</p>

<p class="tb">5. A belief that the moral values we adhere to, support, and
strive toward are grounded on a reality more enduring and
satisfying than any manmade system, which is opposed by
the communist claim that all morality is “class morality”;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span></p>

<p class="tb">6. A belief, which has matured to a firm conviction, that
in the final analysis love is the greatest force on earth and
is far more enduring than hatred; this forbids our accepting
the communist division of mankind that by arbitrary standards
singles out those fit only for liquidation.</p>

<p class="tb">It is only as we thus take stock of what we mean by saying
that our culture has religious roots that we become ready to
make an accurate appraisal of communist ideology and
tactics.</p>

<p>The most basic of all communist comments about religion
is the statement of Karl Marx that religion is “the opium of
the people.” This Marxian doctrine has been restated by
William Z. Foster and applied to communist action in these
words, “... God will be banished from the laboratories as
well as from the schools.”</p>

<p>Inherited from fanatic minds abroad, this mentality poses
today a crucial problem for every patriotic man and woman
in America. If allowed to develop, it will destroy our way
of life.</p>

<p>Communists have always made it clear that communism
is the mortal enemy of Christianity, Judaism, Mohammedanism,
and any other religion that believes in a Supreme
Being.</p>

<p>Don’t think that “the communists have changed their minds
about religion,” said Nikita Khrushchev. “We remain the
Atheists that we have always been; we are doing as much
as we can to liberate those people who are still under the
spell of this religious opiate.” As long as communism remains,
the assault will continue.</p>

<p>To the communists Marxism-Leninism is the “perfect science.”
It accounts for everything; it has a plan for everything:
it can be the source of everything man needs. Therefore, said
Lenin, “We shall always preach a scientific philosophy; we
must fight against the inconsistencies of the ‘Christians’....”</p>

<p>In making Marxism-Leninism the “perfect science,” the
communists characterize religion as a superstitious relic. “Religion,
in its thousands of varieties,” said William Z. Foster,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
“was first evolved by primitive man everywhere as the most
logical explanation he could devise of the complex, mysterious
and often terrifying natural phenomena with which he was
surrounded, as well as to work out a plausible conception of
his own and the world’s existence.”</p>

<p>Though “historically inevitable” for primitive man, Foster
goes on to say, religion has now been made obsolete by science.
Science, as it advanced, gave “irrefutable materialist explanations”
of the phenomena which puzzled primitive man.
Hence, “in the modern world ... there is therefore no longer
... even the possibility, of a religious interpretation of man
and the world.” “It has now become virtually impossible for a
thoroughly modern person, even if he wants to do so, actually
to believe the old legends, primitive philosophies, and imaginary
history upon which all religions are founded.”</p>

<p>This communist teaching glosses over the fact that science
never has given an “irrefutable” explanation of ultimate
reality, neither materialistic nor any other kind. The communists
ignore the further fact that the faith of religious people
is a moral necessity and a sense of personal relationship, not a
completion of laboratory science.</p>

<p>In addition to dismissing religion as primitive, the communists
claim that it is a mere instrument of exploitation: another
weapon in the hands of the capitalists. As Lenin said:
“Religion is a kind of spiritual intoxicant, in which the slaves
of capital drown their humanity, and blunt their desire for a
decent human existence.”</p>

<p>Again: “... it is quite natural for the exploiters to sympathize
with a religion that teaches us to bear ‘uncomplainingly’
the woes of hell on earth, in the hope of an alleged paradise
in the skies.”</p>

<p>William Z. Foster, who in our country emphasizes the same
theme, and who has always emphasized the correct Party line,
declared, “... the Church ... has identified itself with political
reaction.” And again, “... the Church is one of the basic
forces now fighting to preserve obsolete capitalism and its reactionary
ruling classes, in the face of advancing democracy
and socialism.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>The followers of Marx have a way of calling <i>scientific</i> any
dogma to which they intend to cling, regardless of whether it
can be supported by conclusive evidence. And communism
has to cling to its antireligious dogma, not for scientific reasons,
but for reasons of ideology and strategy. It cannot permit
man to give his allegiance to a Supreme Authority higher
than Party authority, for such allegiance to a higher authority
carries with it a sense of freedom, of immunity to Party edict
and discipline. Neither can it afford to have its members made
hesitant in acts of cruelty and deception, which are ordained
parts of its revolutionary program. No communist can be permitted
to set an abstract truth above an expedient lie, or to
extend compassion to an enemy whom the Party intends to
smear or liquidate. The communists dismiss our sentiments
motivated by spiritual force as silly prattlings that reflect
“bourgeois weaknesses.” Therefore, they have their own
morality, communist morality, as stated by Lenin:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">We repudiate all morality that is taken outside of human,
class concepts.... We say that our morality is entirely subordinated
to the interests of the class struggle....</p>

</div>

<p>Lenin made clear the function of communist morality: “At
the root of Communist morality, there lies the continuation
and completion of Communism.” In practice this has simply
meant that the end justifies the means. That is why a communist
can commit murder, pillage, destruction, and terror, and
feel proud; lie and feel no compunction; seek to destroy the
American form of government and feel justified. Communism
has turned the values of Western civilization upside down.</p>

<p>Hatred of all gods was Karl Marx’s credo. Yet communism
is, in effect, a secular religion with its own roster of gods, its
own Messianic zeal, and its own fanatical devotees who are
willing to accept any personal sacrifice that furthers the cause.</p>

<p>It would seem that communists, in view of the above, would
make clear, always and at every point, their opposition to
religion. Often, however, tactics have made it necessary to
play down or to conceal entirely the Party’s intentions in line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
with Lenin’s advice: “... but this does not mean that the religious
question must be pushed into the foreground where it
does not belong.” The communists realize that the vast majority
of noncommunists believe in God. Too bold an approach
might antagonize them, doing the Party more harm
than good.</p>

<p>In the early days, before Party discipline was established,
Lenin counseled: “The Anarchist, who preaches war against
God at all costs, actually helps the ... bourgeoisie....” William
Z. Foster, rebuking the extreme left, said that some of
their efforts at “God killing” served only for “... overstress
and distortion of the religious question.”</p>

<p>By 1937 such tactical caution was beginning to be replaced
by a calculated program to exploit religion. Foster called this
the “... more recent practical approach to the religious question,
on the basis long ago laid by Lenin.”</p>

<p>This “practical approach” means attempting, through deceptive
tactics, to capture support from American religious
groups for an atheistic Communist Party. As Foster put it in
1937:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">In consequence, the antireligious Communist Party is now
to be found in close united front cooperation with dozens of
churches and other religious organizations on questions of immediate
economic and political interest to the toiling masses.</p>

</div>

<p>In line with these tactics, the Party is today engaged in a
systematic program to infiltrate American religious groups.
“The Communist Party,” said the National Committee in
1954, “declares that it seeks no conflict with any church or
any American’s religious belief. On the contrary, we stretch
out our hand in the fellowship of common struggle for our
mutual goal of peace, democracy and security to all regardless
of religious belief.” Members are being told: “Join churches
and become involved in church work.”</p>

<p>The Party’s objectives inside religious groups are several:</p>

<p class="tb">1. <i>To gain “respectability”</i>: “... a church is the best front<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
we can have.” Comrades, by associating in church circles,
secure an “acceptable” status in the community, greater
credence for their opinions, and the lulling of noncommunist
suspicions.</p>

<p class="tb">2. <i>To provide an opportunity for the subtle dissemination
of communist propaganda.</i> Churches are convincing places in
which to identify communist programs with such genuine religious
values as “peace,” “brotherhood,” “justice.” One member
bragged how in a church talk he had “plugged” for Marx.
The communists are careful, however, not to overdo it. One
fellow was too ambitious. He was challenged by alert church
members and relieved of his leadership duties.</p>

<p class="tb">3. <i>To make contact with youth</i>: through class discussions,
recreational affairs, etc. The object is not necessarily to recruit
(although in one church several young people did join) but to
plant a seed of Marxist-Leninist thought.</p>

<p class="tb">4. <i>To exploit the church in the Party’s day-to-day agitational
program.</i> In the 1930’s and 1940’s the approach was
chiefly through “immediate economic and political” problems,
with the Party attempting to exploit the church’s legitimate
interest in better housing and the elimination of social injustices.</p>

<p>Today this tactic is overshadowed by the “peace” issue.
Every possible deceptive device is being used to link the
Party’s “peace” program with the church. One Communist
Party section issued instructions that every clergyman in the
community be contacted to give a sermon on “peace.” Encourage
“Party church members” to organize discussion groups,
perhaps showing a “peace” film. If possible, circulate “peace”
literature. If you can’t get inside, stand outside. One organizer
said: “We are to dress up like other people and stand outside
churches in our neighborhoods and use the slogan, ‘Peace on
earth, good will toward men.’”</p>

<p class="tb">5. <i>To enlarge the area of Party contacts.</i> One Party section<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
advocated: Join small churches (100 to 500 membership), so
that one can more easily work himself into a position of leadership.
Make as many personal contacts as possible. Learn
where the church member works, what his hobbies are, etc.
Someday he might be used. One Party member, active in
youth work, learned that the parents of several young people
were working in an industrial plant. Securing this information
was most important, he said.</p>

<p class="tb">6. <i>To influence clergymen.</i> A dedicated clergyman, being a
man of God, is a mortal enemy of communism. But if he can,
by conversion, influence, or trickery, be made to support the
communist program once or a few times or many times, the
Party gains. If, for example, a clergyman can be persuaded to
serve as sponsor or officer of a communist front, to issue a
testimonial or to sign a clemency petition for a communist
“victim of persecution,” his personal prestige lends weight to
the cause.</p>

<p>The church, in communist eyes, is an “enemy” institution
to be infiltrated, subverted, and bent to serve Party aims. Any
successes make the comrades diabolically happy. One member,
talking to her communist friends, laughed about prayers
in church. “Who wants to hear such stuff, but what can I do?
That’s the only way I can get in there.”</p>

<p>We might expect, considering the importance of materialism
in communist theory, that the Party’s constitution would
set forth atheism as a basic principle of communism. But “...
we do not declare,” said Lenin, “and must not declare in our
programme that we are ‘Atheists’....”</p>

<p>The Party’s aim, in addition to that of exploiting the church,
is to neutralize religion as an effective counterweapon. At
present virtually nothing is being said in open Party propaganda
that is antireligious. Pamphlet after pamphlet is issued
on civil rights, “peace,” “democracy”; very few on religion.
Communists in the United States, however, are on record in
regard to their views on religion: for example, Earl Browder,
<i>Communism in the United States</i> (1935), pages 334-49; William
Z. Foster, <i>The Twilight of World Capitalism</i> (1949),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
pages 87-99 and “Reply to a Priest’s Letter,” <i>Political Affairs</i>
(October, 1954). Also, a pamphlet, <i>Science and Religion</i>, by
Marcel Cachin (1946), editor of <i>L’Humanité</i>, French communist
newspaper, has been circulated.</p>

<p>If members are forced to present the Party’s views, they are
instructed to stress, as Lenin did, that religion is a “private
matter” for the individual, and to pose as “tolerant.” Doesn’t
the Party’s constitution say that a person is eligible for membership
“regardless of ... religious belief”? The object here is
to dull the vigilance of the noncommunist mind and to make
religious belief appear as something minor, secondary, and inconsequential.</p>

<p>When tactically expedient, the communists even liken themselves
to the early Christian martyrs suffering persecution for
attempting to aid mankind.</p>

<p>One cartoon published in <i>The Worker</i> shows a sketch of
Christ in the form of a wanted criminal. The caption reads:
<i><span class="allsmcap">REWARD</span> for Information Leading to the Apprehension of</i>—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span></p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="smcap">Wanted</span>—for Sedition, Criminal
Anarchy, Vagrancy, and Conspiring
to Overthrow the Established Government</p>

<p>Dresses poorly. <i>Said</i> to be a carpenter by trade, ill
nourished, has visionary ideas, associates with common
working people, the unemployed and bums ... Alias:
“Prince of Peace. Son of Man” ... <i>Professional agitator.</i></p>

<p>Red beard, marks on hands and feet the result of injuries
inflicted by an angry mob led by respectable
citizens and legal authorities.</p>

</div>

<p>A <i>Daily Worker</i> writer, reviewing a movie in which the
background was laid in the early Christian era, says: “Some
interesting parallels can be found between the persecution of
the Christians shown in the film and the political jailings in
the United States today.”</p>

<p>Behind these deceptive tactics, however, can be seen the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
real nature of communism. For the member, religion is <i>not</i> a
private affair. No tolerance is allowed. He cannot be a Marxist
and adhere to a religion. The Party is today desperately working
to mold atheistic materialism as a weapon of revolution, a
revolution which, if it is to succeed, must first sap religion’s
spiritual strength and then destroy it.</p>

<p>The Party’s attack can be traced through four stages:</p>

<p class="tb">1. <i>Recruitment</i>: keyed to the Party’s general approach toward
noncommunists, the issue of religion is minimized. “Try
to win recruits on the basis of wages and the class struggle
rather than religion,” and, “Go ahead and tell a fellow you believe
in God to keep from getting into an argument.” Likewise
it is urged, “If we approach a church-goer we do not hit him
over the head and tell him his idea is crazy. We take a tactical
approach....”</p>

<p>Lenin’s advice still holds: “We must not only admit ... all
those workers who still retain faith in God, we must redouble
our efforts to recruit them. We are absolutely opposed to the
slightest affront to these workers’ religious convictions. We
recruit them in order to educate them in the spirit of our programme....”</p>

<p class="tb">2. <i>Early indoctrination</i>: keyed to patience if recruits continue
to attend church after joining the Party. They must be
gradually “educated.” If new members begin to ask questions,
they are to be made to feel, not that their fellow communists
are trying to take away their belief, but that these communists
are “advanced thinkers,” that they hold a “scientific” concept
of the universe, and that religion is to them simply “old-fashioned.”
Typical of what members are told are these comments
made by communist leaders:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—“How silly to think there is a God.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—“Religion comes from primitive man’s worship of such things
as thunder, lightning and the sun.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—“Religion was used as an explanation of unanswerable questions,
such as ‘Why does it rain?’ Answer: ‘God willed it.’”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p class="tb">3. <i>Special indoctrination</i>: keyed to the real job of teaching
Marxist materialism are special indoctrination classes. “Our
programme thus necessarily includes the propaganda of atheism,”
said Lenin, directing his words, of course, to Party members.</p>

<p>A few statements from Party members reveal how persistent
is the communist fight against God:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">—“The concept of God is manmade and is based on ignorance.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—“Marxism-Leninism is a science and has solved the mysteries
of religion.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—“To be a true communist you have to be an atheist.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—“Communism will supplant religion and will keep you warm
and give you all the comforts of healthful living.”</p>

<p class="hanging">—“Religious people fear facts and resort to such things as prayer
to end war, but prayers are actually futile and leave war to
the capitalists while people sit around praying.”</p>

</div>

<p class="tb">4. <i>Final goal</i>: the utter elimination of all religion (called
“bourgeois remnants”) from the heart, mind, and soul of
man, and the total victory of atheistic communism. Religious
attitudes keep cropping up, however, even in the trained
member. One individual admitted that it had taken him a long
time to give up his religion. “It was one of the hardest parts
of my Party development.”</p>

<p>Even in Soviet Russia, after a generation of the most bitter
propaganda, religion is far from exterminated. “One of the
most widespread traces of the past in the minds of the people,”
said one Soviet writer, “is religious superstition and darkness,
survivals of the old, antiscientific conceptions of nature,
society and of man himself.” He adds, “The historic victories
of atheism in our country do not mean, however, that religion
is over and done with. There are still among us no few believers,
i.e., people who continue to remain in the fetters of
religion.”</p>

<p>To combat these religious “remnants,” says this Soviet
writer, more antireligious propaganda is needed. “... forming
an advanced, materialist outlook in the rising generation and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
combating every type of superstition and religious belief make
up a most important sector in the fight for the communist education
of youth.” Another Soviet writer states, “Convincing,
profoundly reasoned propaganda of atheism which does not
offend the feelings of believers is the main characteristic of all
antireligious work at the present moment.”</p>

<p>Here, then, is the fight the communist leaders wage. We do
not believe they can ever win it. These so-called “religious
survivals” represent something far deeper in man than the
communists can grant: some eternal reaching toward a creative
source. But if the Party does not realize the true nature and
strength of these “survivals,” it does realize that religion
is its most potent foe. To meet this challenge no hesitant, indifferent,
half-apologetic acts on our own part can suffice. Out
of the deep roots of religion flows something warm and good,
the affirmation of love and justice; here is the source of
strength for our land if we are to remain free. It is ours to defend
and to nourish.</p>

<i>How to Stay Free</i></h3>

</div>

<p>The communist revolution in Russia is forty years behind
us. In these four decades communism has had a chance to
show what it does with power in its hands; how it treats the
people who live under it; what its attitudes are toward law,
education, science, and religion; how it handles its relations
with the noncommunist world. It stands condemned on its
own record. It has revealed basic errors in theory and practice
which will eventually bring about its downfall. To turn around
Karl Marx’s famous comment on capitalism, communism is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
digging its own grave. It cannot survive because it is anti-God
and anti-man.</p>

<p>For all too long, communism’s true character has been concealed
by its own propaganda, abetted by public ignorance
and apathy. Soviet Russia was hailed as an “advanced democracy”
and communism as “twentieth-century Americanism.”
Such phrases deceived free people and gave the Party a protective
cloak.</p>

<p>Marxism-Leninism stands revealed not as a “new world”
of hope and justice but as an evil conspiracy in pursuit of
power. Its cost in human misery and waste of human life is
almost beyond description. Every home in America today is
deprived of an even higher standard of living as a result of the
tax burden brought on by the utter necessity of keeping our
defenses strong against the world-wide advance of communism.</p>

<p>Time has also erased the label of “scientific” from Marxist-Leninist
ideology. The communist claim of “infallible” has
proved to be all too fallible time and again. The revolution
began not in a highly industrialized state but in a backward,
tyranny-ridden land where communism meant the substitution
of an even more vicious brand of tyranny. It was conducted
not as a “dictatorship of the proletariat” but as a dictatorship
by dictators who rode roughshod over the workingman.
Stalin, in the middle 1930’s, contended that socialism was at
last fully established in Russia and that the movement from
then on would be toward the second stage which Marx had
foretold: true communism and the withering away of the
state. Even as Stalin spoke, in terms designed to attract
idealists, he was making the state ever more powerful. After
his death, with the “New Look” and the Khrushchev “thaw,”
the trend has not been reversed.</p>

<p>Khrushchev gives the answer to those who still repeat the
shabby, deceitful phrases of communist dogma, when he desanctifies
Stalin one day and on the next day rehabilitates
him as a good communist. After all, Stalin during his life was
the Chief Executioner, and Khrushchev did his bidding, along
with many of his associates who rule Russia today. Khrushchev’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
answer should never be forgotten, because by his own
words the alleged “paradise of human joy” was, in fact, a
world of slave labor camps, betrayed human rights, and calculated
fear.</p>

<p>The answer also comes from Mao Tse-tung, the Chinese
communist dictator who, without apparent shame, admitted
that 800,000 of his fellow countrymen had been liquidated
between 1949 and the beginning of 1954. The answer further
comes from the Hungarian Freedom Fighters of 1956, who
with bare hands attacked the steel of Soviet tanks.</p>

<p>The answer finally comes from those Americans who were
victimized by the communist deception of claiming credit
for reforms and advances which the Party did not deserve.
Most informed Americans now know that the communists
adopt a cause only to exploit it for their own ends. Communism
does not mean better housing, improved social conditions,
or a more strict observance of civil rights. The vast
majority of Negro leaders have rebuffed the communists’ attempts
to exploit them. By forcing Party members out of
positions of authority and even from union membership, true
trade unionists have shown their awareness that communists
seek to disrupt the legitimate mission of labor unions.</p>

<p>Communism, in brief, has bitterly indicted communism;
communist practice has indicted communist theory; communist
actions have indicated the perverted use of such lofty
words as “peace,” “justice,” and “liberty.”</p>

<p>But we cannot afford the luxury of waiting for communism
to run its course like other oppressive dictatorships. The
weapons of communism are still formidable. They become
even more effective when we lower our guard and when we
become lax in strengthening our democratic institutions in
perfecting the American dream.</p>

<p>The call of the future must be a rekindled American faith,
based on our priceless heritage of freedom, justice, and the
religious spirit.</p>

<p>In our reawakening, we Americans can learn a great deal
from the fight against communism. Here are five special
areas:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span></p>

<p class="tb">1. The communists emphasize <i>ideological study</i>, meaning,
of course, Marxism-Leninism. Such study has been the very
foundation of their “monolithic unity”: their power to keep
people in line no matter how the “line” changes. Their study
allows no deviation for free thought and independent action.
Also, it provides them with a “common language” since all
communists give the same meaning to words and acts. This
emphasis upon study has been the means whereby they have
captured the minds of some of our young people who read
and think and who are lacking in proper companionship.</p>

<p>It is sad but true that many young people have been
drawn into communist clubs or study groups. Often they are
highly intellectual but lonely students and fall under a
sinister influence. We know this from the experiences of
hundreds of former communists and from acts of near-treason
we have been called upon to investigate.</p>

<p>American education, of course, does not make communists;
communist education does. Communism, to survive, must
depend upon a constant program of education, because communism
needs educated people, even though it distorts the use
to which their education is put. Thus, we need to show our
young people, particularly those endowed with high intellects,
that we in our democracy need what they have to offer.</p>

<p>We, as a people, have not been sufficiently articulate and
forceful in expressing pride in our traditions and ideals. In our
homes and schools we need to learn how to “let freedom ring.”
In all the civilized world there is no story which compares
with America’s effort to become free and to incorporate freedom
in our institutions. This story, told factually and dramatically,
needs to become the basis for our American unity and
for our unity with all free peoples. I am sure most Americans
believe that our light of freedom is a shining light. As Americans
we should stand up, speak of it, and let the world see
this light, rather than conceal it. For too long we have had a
tendency to keep silent while the communists, their sympathizers,
and their fellow travelers have been telling the
world what is wrong with democracy. Suppose every American
spent a little time each day, less than the time demanded by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
the communists, in studying the Bible and the basic documents
of American history, government, and culture? The
result would be a new America, vigilant, strong, but ever
humble in the service of God.</p>

<p class="tb">2. Then there is the training of <i>youth</i>, on whom the communists
place so much emphasis. To the Party, youth is not
something auxiliary but an important training ground. We
must meet this challenge. America must devote the best of
her efforts to make youth responsible, conscious of its obligations,
and eager to be good citizens. Experience and observation
point to certain facts which we need to consider in
providing for youth.</p>

<p>First, youth gravitates toward youth. The young person
who feels left out may remain a “solitary.” Or he may, according
to his background and make-up, join a delinquent
gang. He may join a Party front or club. Or he may find some
other short cut to a sense of belonging. But every American
youth has a right to find some place within a group that expresses
rather than contradicts the real values of society.</p>

<p>Second, given half a chance, youth gravitates toward companionship
with competent, generous, and experienced adults.
Practically all my life I have been face to face with young
people becoming involved in difficulties or coming under the
communist spell. Invariably I have discovered that they all had
one thing in common. In their early years and in the periods
of their lives when their transgressions began to take form,
they could not talk things over with their parents. Their
parents were either too busy, or not interested, or resented
any difference of opinion. Or parents simply doled out “final”
answers when the young people wanted to try to think things
through.</p>

<p>Our youth want not only to talk to adults, they want to
work with adults. It is a fine thing for them to have their own
groups, but it is better if, in addition, they can participate
in shared projects with adults. If the adults can show, in
action, that it is possible to combine high idealism with solid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
practicality and patience, the results will enhance character
and citizenship development manyfold.</p>

<p class="tb">3. The communists stress <i>action</i>. This means carrying out
our responsibilities now—not tomorrow, the next day, or never.
To communists the Party means continual action, not just
talk, waiting for annual elections, meetings, or affairs. With
us action must supplement good intentions in building the
America of the future. We need to provide our youth with
activity groups. To give them only a high standard of material
advantages or a constant diet of recreation is not enough.
Recreation must be made part of a life of responsibility, otherwise
it becomes merely a preface to boredom. Our young
people, as well as adults, need to be working members of our
republic and citizens on duty at all times.</p>

<p class="tb">4. Communists accent the <i>positive</i>. In their deceptive and
perverted way they are always purporting to stand for something
positive. “Better,” “higher,” etc., are trade-marks in their
language. We, too, in the true sense of the word, should
strive for goals that are genuinely better, higher, and more
noble, trying to improve self, community, and nation. A strictly
negative attitude or the philosophy of just staying afloat—all
too common today—will never meet the impact of the communist
challenge.</p>

<p class="tb">5. Most important of all is <i>faith</i>. Let us not blind ourselves
to the fact that communists do have a “faith.” True, it is
falsely placed, but still it inspires them to sacrifice, devotion,
and a perverted idealism.</p>

<p>The late Mother Bloor, the Party’s woman “hero,” often
praised Walt Whitman’s “The Mystic Trumpeter” as the poem
she loved best. It seemed, she said, to prophesy the coming
of a “new world”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">War, sorrow, suffering gone—the rank earth purged—nothing but joy left!</div><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ocean fill’d with joy—the atmosphere all joy!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Joy! joy! in freedom, worship, love! joy in the ecstasy of life!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Enough to merely be! enough to breathe! Joy! joy! all over joy!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">She is trying to identify communism with the dream of a
world of joy. She is exploiting Walt Whitman. Yet her feeling
shows the lure of communist “faith.” If communists can be so
inspired from error, falsehood, and hate, just think what we
could do with truth, justice, and love! I thrill to think of the
even greater wonders America could fashion from its rich,
glorious, and deep tradition. All we need is faith, <i>real faith</i>.</p>

<p>The communist prides himself on being a revolutionary—and
revolutionary he is in the sense of destruction, terror, and
violence. Free man can learn here too: the truly revolutionary
force of history is not material power but the spirit of religion.
The world today needs a true revolution of the fruitful
spirit, not the futile sword. Hypocrisy, dishonesty, hatred, all
these must be destroyed and man must rule by love, charity,
and mercy.</p>

<p>The Party’s effort to create “communist man,” to mold a
revolutionary fighter completely subservient to the Party’s
desires, is destined to fail. The power of bullets, tanks, and
repression will bulwark tyranny just so long. Then, as the
Hungarian Freedom Fighters proved, man’s innate desire for
freedom will flare up stronger than ever. In communism we
see what happens when freedom is extinguished. This must
give us renewed zeal to work untiringly to uphold the ideals
of justice and liberty which have made this nation great.</p>

<p>With God’s help, America will remain a land where people
still know how to be free and brave.</p>

</div>

<p>This glossary contains terms frequently used by communists.
Their meanings are derived largely from communist “classics,” or
books written by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin (For a more
complete definition of communist “classics,” see Bibliography,
page 328.)</p>

<h4>BOLSHEVIK:</h4>

<p>1. Refers to a type of communist organization, namely, Lenin’s
Party, of a small, selective membership, comprised of highly trained
professional revolutionaries insolubly linked to each other by the
deepest revolutionary convictions and discipline. The term “bolshevik”
stems from the Russian word <i>bolshinstvo</i>, meaning majority.
In the 1903 Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labor
Party, a dispute occurred over whether membership should be
tightly controlled (Lenin’s idea) or be open to sympathizers also.
Lenin’s opinion was accepted. Hence, his supporters became known
as Bolsheviks (majority); his opponents as Mensheviks (minority).</p>

<p>2. Refers to a certain type of Party member, namely, the
model, heroic, ideal type of communist. It is a term of high praise
and distinction for communists, signifying superiority and mastery
of the qualities of revolutionary leadership, efficiency, courage.
Hence the terms “bolshevik courage,” “bolshevik culture,” “bolshevik
discipline.” “Bolshevization of the Party” means to make the
Party a model of communist perfection.</p>

<h4>BOURGEOISIE:</h4>

<p>Term applied to the “capitalist” class, which includes not only
the wealthy but also middle-class people. Sometimes “petty bourgeoisie”
is used to distinguish small businessmen, minor government
officials, etc., from the more wealthy “capitalists” and high-ranking
officials. To communists the bourgeoisie is a class enemy
which must be destroyed. “Bourgeois” is the adjective form of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
bourgeoisie, hence, “bourgeois virtue.” So used, the word describes
anything or anybody whom communists would ridicule or hold
in contempt. The term “bourgeois survivals,” or “bourgeois remnants,”
refers to so-called “capitalist” (that is, noncommunist)
attitudes and institutions not yet obliterated by communism.</p>

<h4>CADRE:</h4>

<p>The trusted inner circle of trained members and leaders on
whom the Party can depend to carry out its policies and programs
without any questions or objections. From cadres will emerge functionaries,
officials, organizers. “The Party cadres constitute the
commanding staff of the Party....” (<i>Stalin</i>)</p>

<h4>CAPITALISM:</h4>

<p>To communists, capitalism is an economic system based on
the private ownership of property, the private control of the means
of production, and the private accumulation and use of profits.
As such, communists consider capitalism to be a form of exploitation
of man by man. To them, capitalism is the last economic
system of exploitation in the social evolution of man. Born as the
result of overthrowing feudalism, capitalism, in turn, from its own
inner contradictions, will be succeeded by socialism as a transitory
stage that will end in a world communist society.</p>

<h4>CENTRISM:</h4>

<p>A term of contempt to communists, signifying those who try to
pursue a “middle-of-the-road” position, thereby denying full and
undeviating obedience to the Party line. “... and finally, there
are the ‘Centrists,’ those who wobble between the ‘Lefts’ and the
Rights.... Centrism is a political concept. Its ideology is one of
adaptation, of subordination of the interests of the proletariat to
the interests of the petty-bourgeoisie in the <i>same</i> party. This
ideology is alien and contrary to Leninism.” (<i>Stalin</i>)</p>

<h4>CHAUVINISM:</h4>

<p>A term of bad repute to communists signifying that one nation,
race, group, or individual assumes an attitude of biased superiority.
Within the Party structure chauvinism (which can occur in various
forms) often results in disciplinary action and becomes a weapon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
whereby the ruling clique can bring charges against opponents
for the purpose of weakening or destroying them.</p>

<h4>CLASS:</h4>

<p>By the word “class,” communists mean a section of a given
population that occupies a specific relation to the means of production.
For example, the capitalists own land, mines, factories,
and the like. The workers or laborers do not own such possessions
but work on the land and in the mines and factories. Therefore,
there are two main classes in society: (1) the capitalist or bourgeoisie,
and (2) the wage-earners or working class or proletariat.
The communists admit that in highly developed capitalist nations
(as the United States) there is another group, the “middle class”
or “petty bourgeoisie,” composed of minor merchants, small
farmers, professional people, small businessmen, etc. The communists
believe the “middle class” can be influenced to support
the proletariat.</p>

<h4>CLASS STRUGGLE:</h4>

<p>To the communists the two basic classes in capitalist society,
the bourgeoisie and proletariat, are in constant and inevitable
economic conflict. This struggle is a continuation of the age-old
conflict, say the communists, between the exploiters and the exploited;
the rulers and the ruled; those who own the means
of production and the great masses of the people who possess
nothing but their capacity for laboring. In the early days this class
struggle was between the slave owner and the slave (slavery), later
between the feudal lords and the serfs (feudalism). Eventually,
the communists claim, the capitalists will be defeated through
violent revolution; and by applying the dictatorship of the proletariat,
communist society will be established. The communists
are constantly encouraging class struggle, trying to increase social,
economic, and political tensions. To them class struggle is an
agency for promoting communism. “Can the capitalists be forced
out and the roots of capitalism be annihilated without a bitter
class struggle? No, it is impossible.” (<i>Stalin</i>)</p>

<h4>COMMUNISM (MARXIST SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM):</h4>

<p>A system of thought and action originated by Karl Marx and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
Friedrich Engels, developed by V. I. Lenin, continued by Joseph
Stalin and his successors. This system advocates, among other
things: (1) a materialistic explanation of the origin of man and
the universe; (2) a comprehensive economic interpretation of
history centering about the class struggle; (3) abolition of the
noncommunist state, which is conceived to be an instrument of
exploitation; (4) a revolutionary theory, method, and a flexible
course of action to overthrow the state and the capitalistic system;
(5) a moral code based on utility; on nonsupernatural class concepts;
(6) abolition of all religions; (7) a world-wide communist
revolution; and (8) a world-wide communist society.</p>

<h4>COMMUNISM (primitive):</h4>

<p>A type of communal living reported to have existed in early
stages of man’s history. To Marxists there was no private ownership,
hence, no class divisions, class exploitation, or state mechanism.</p>

<h4>COMMUNISM (stages of development):</h4>

<p>Marxism-Leninism says communism will develop through two
basic stages: <i>First or lower stage</i> (called socialism), which is the
type of society that will be formed immediately after the communist
revolution. This is an “impure” communist society, freshly
emerged from the violent conflict and bearing, in the words of
Marx, “... in every respect, economic, moral and intellectual, the
birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it is issuing.” In
this phase, organs of the state (such as police, army, etc.) are
necessary and are exercised by the dictatorship of the proletariat,
crushing the opposition of the bourgeoisie. During this transitory
stage the main principle will be “from each according to his
ability, to each according to his work.” (This is the stage of the
dictatorship of the proletariat, symbolized by the terrorism that
now prevails in all communist countries.) However, after an unspecified
period of time (just when, no communist can say), as
people become indoctrinated to the principles of Marxism-Leninism,
all the capitalistic characteristics will disappear and the state will
slowly “wither away” as the threshold of the <i>higher or final stage</i>
(communism) will be reached. This stage will be stateless, classless,
godless, where all property will be held in common and human<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
activities will conform to the principle “from each according to his
abilities, to each according to his needs.” The lower phase implies
controlled, planned, and ordered work; the higher, free
association and voluntary work. (This false appeal to a communist
Utopia is one of the Party’s most potent weapons for deception.)</p>

<h4>COMPROMISE (MANEUVER, CONCESSIONS):</h4>

<p>Tactics whereby, in order to promote the ultimate goal of communism,
adjustments and temporary agreements can be made with
the enemy, that is, the noncommunist world. “Concessions do not
mean peace with capitalism, but war on a new plane.” (<i>Lenin</i>)</p>

<h4>DEMOCRACY:</h4>

<p>In discussing the communist concept of democracy, distinction
must be made between what the Party calls <i>bourgeois democracy</i>
and <i>proletarian democracy</i>. The communists claim that “bourgeois”
or “capitalist” democracy (as in the United States) is limited, repressive,
and favors the minority; “... in capitalist society we
have a democracy that is curtailed, wretched, false; a democracy
only for the rich, for the minority.” (<i>Lenin</i>) After seizure of power
the communists then will inaugurate, they say, “proletarian”
democracy (as in Hungary and Russia), which will be “... a
million times more democratic than any bourgeois democracy.”
Here the dictatorship of the proletariat will be in power, utterly
crushing any capitalist opposition. Eventually, however, this “proletarian”
democracy will be supplanted by full communism,
which, among other things, will be stateless. Basically the communists
abhor democracy as practiced in the United States, believing,
as they do, in dictatorship, force and violence, and the
supreme authority of the Party. However, the Party seeks to
utilize “capitalist” democracy and its rights (of which it falsely
claims to be a protector) in order to promote its own cause.</p>

<h4>DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM:</h4>

<p>The rigid principle that the decisions of the highest body in
the Communist Party (even though it be dominated by one man)
are binding upon all lower bodies or organizational units in the
Party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span></p>

<h4>DEVIATION:</h4>

<p>The departure from the policy and line established by the
Party. It may either be to the left (known as left-wing sectarianism)
or to the right (right-wing opportunism). Regardless, any
deviation from a 100 per cent acceptance of the Party line is
regarded as a serious situation and a matter for disciplinary action.
Obviously, any original thinking or varied interpretations of Party
policy are impossible.</p>

<h4>DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM:</h4>

<p>The philosophy and world outlook that undergirds communism.
“Dialectical materialism is the world outlook of the
Marxist-Leninist party. It is called dialectical materialism because
its approach to the phenomena of nature, its methods of studying
and apprehending them, is <i>dialectical</i>, while its interpretation of
the phenomena of nature, its conception of these phenomena, its
theory, is <i>materialistic</i>.” (<i>Stalin</i>) See <b>DIALECTICS</b> and <b>MATERIALISM</b>.</p>

<h4>DIALECTICS (DIALECTICAL):</h4>

<p>One of the most frequently used terms in communist literature.
The word is derived from the Greek, meaning the art of discourse,
reasoning, and debate. To communists the stress in dialectics (the
process of argument and counterargument to reach a higher meaning)
is placed on change, the ceaseless ebb and flow of material
elements. To them the world is constantly changing; nothing is
eternal. All political and economic systems have within themselves
the seeds of their own destruction, and as time passes they
decay and give way to higher forms of existence in man’s climb
up the ladder of progress. This change, however, is not just
for the sake of change alone, but follows a specific direction (such
a type of change is called <i>revolutionary change</i>), from the lower
to the higher, meaning a change from the lower stages of man’s
development, slavery, feudalism, and capitalism, to his highest—that
is, world-wide communism. When this final stage is reached,
say the communists, change will stop, since “full” communism
conforms perfectly to the revolutionary nature of matter. Unlike
other systems of life, communism claims not to contain within
itself the seeds of destruction. It should be emphasized that even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
though noncommunist thinkers time after time have pointed out the
inconsistencies, fallacies, and errors of this concept, communists
cling to it with undying devotion.</p>

<h4>DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT:</h4>

<p>One of the most fundamental of communist concepts, meaning
the forcible dictatorship of the Communist Party (conceived as
the vanguard of the workers), whereby capitalist opposition is
crushed after the seizure of power. It is also viewed as a transitional
period between the revolution and the final goal—communism. The
dictatorship of the proletariat is one of the most brutal of communist
concepts, being based on naked force and violence, not
law. “The revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat is power
won and maintained by the violence of the proletariat against
the bourgeoisie, power that is unrestricted by any laws.” (<i>Lenin</i>)</p>

<h4>DISCIPLINE:</h4>

<p>A cardinal feature in maintaining the monolithic unity of the
Party. Discipline becomes a whip binding the membership under
the authority of the Party, stifling free opinion and making for
uniformity. A Communist Party without a ruthless discipline would
be unthinkable.</p>

<h4>FACTION (FACTIONALISM):</h4>

<p>A grouping of members of the Communist Party around one
or more ideas that are at variance with the Party line. Factionalism
is the conflict caused by the presence of such factions. The
monolithic structure and strong discipline of the Party usually
result in the brutal crushing or expulsion of factions. In communist
theory and practice there can be no freedom of dissent.</p>

<h4>FORCE AND VIOLENCE:</h4>

<p>The necessary means whereby, according to the communists,
the existing or old society will be finally overthrown and the new
or communist society established. “Force is the midwife of every
old society pregnant with a new one.” (<i>Marx</i>) “The replacement
of the bourgeois by the proletarian state is impossible without a
violent revolution.” (<i>Lenin</i>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<h4>HISTORIC MISSION:</h4>

<p>To communists this means the seizure of power, the establishment
of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the abolition of capitalism,
and the formation of the new, communist, society. As the
vanguard of the proletariat the Communist Party has as its
“historic mission” the direction of the proletarian struggle toward
a communist society.</p>

<h4>IMPERIALISM:</h4>

<p>The highest, the most developed, and last stage of a “moribund”
and “decaying” capitalism. As worked out by Lenin, imperialism
develops when capital and production (in a capitalist
society) become concentrated in the hands of a relatively few
individuals on high economic levels. This causes, according to
Lenin, capitalist exploitation in colonial areas, as capital seeks an
outlet for greater markets. This monopoly stage of capitalism
“causes” imperialist wars, as rival capitalist systems struggle with
each other (this was Lenin’s diagnosis of World War I). To
modern-day communists, the United States is now in this stage
of imperialism.</p>

<h4>INEVITABILITY:</h4>

<p>To communists the final outcome of the struggle between
communists and noncommunists has already been decided in favor
of the communists, due to the very nature of the struggle. They
consider the victory of communism to be inevitable because it is
a “necessary product of historical development.” They view
progress to be from slavery to feudalism, to capitalism, to imperialism,
to communism.</p>

<h4>MARXISM-LENINISM:</h4>

<p>See <b>COMMUNISM (MARXIST SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM)</b>.</p>

<h4>MASSES:</h4>

<p>The ordinary people of a society who are not “educated” in
the science of Marxism-Leninism and hence must be led by the
proletariat and its vanguard, the Communist Party, toward the
goal of a communist society. “Radicalizing the masses” signifies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
efforts by the Party, through agitation, to make the masses more
sympathetic to communist aims.</p>

<h4>MATERIALISM:</h4>

<p>A view of reality which asserts that (1) matter is the basic
reality and God does not exist; (2) the universe and all life on it
can be explained in terms of motion and matter; (3) human values
should center around material considerations, satisfactions and
pleasures; and (4) the interpretation of human history must rest
on material elements. Materialism is as old as man, but Marx
claimed that his form of materialism (linked with dialectics) was
the only complete and true form. The main premise of materialism
is atheism, and hence the denial of God and all values which
stem from religion. This fight against religion has been one of the
Party’s most basic principles. Under communism, ethics and
morality become completely transformed, being based not on
religion but on Party expediency. The results have been devastating—that
millions of men and women have suffered and died in the
name of a perverted “justice” and “goodness.”</p>

<p>(Materialism as here defined should not be confused with the
popular conception of the term denoting inordinate desire for
material goods, thirst for power, undisciplined sensual appetites,
or the hunger for the passing fame and glory of the world.)</p>

<h4>OPPORTUNISM (RIGHT-WING):</h4>

<p>Represents one type of deviation from the Party line, to the
right, hence right-wing opportunism. This deviation is characterized
as too much cooperation with capitalism, causing the Party to lose
its identity as the “leader of the masses.” This was the error of
Browder.</p>

<h4>PARTY:</h4>

<p>Organizational concept evolved by Lenin of those trained in
Marxism-Leninism who, regarding themselves as a “vanguard,”
are to lead the proletariat (and hence the masses) toward a communist
world society. Under communism the Party becomes all-powerful,
directing all phases of activity. Strict standards of membership
are set, the most important being that members must be
completely obedient to Party wishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span></p>

<h4>PARTY LINE:</h4>

<p>The sum total of the Party’s decisions, aims, programs, and
demands at any given time. Distinction must always be made between
the “deceptive” Party line (that is, the programs designed
for public consumption) and the “real” Party line (the true Party
purpose designed to advance the interests of communism). The
Party line often switches, sometimes very violently in various
areas.</p>

<h4>PHILISTINE:</h4>

<p>Any person who believes in communism but is timid and
shrinks from class struggle. He is a “fair-weather” soldier who supports
communism when it is easy to do so but deserts when the
going becomes rough. Philistinism is a term of abuse. “What is a
philistine? A hollow gut, full of fear and hope, that God have
mercy!” (<i>Lenin</i>) Communists would include some socialists, reformists,
and liberals in this definition.</p>

<h4>PROFESSIONAL REVOLUTIONARIES:</h4>

<p>Those Party members, thoroughly educated in Marxism-Leninism,
who dedicate their entire lives to the Party. This body
(cadre) of members, in communist eyes, represents the shock
troops of revolution. “Give us an organisation of revolutionaries,
and we shall overturn the whole of Russia!” (<i>Lenin</i>)</p>

<h4>PROLETARIAN INTERNATIONALISM:</h4>

<p>The belief that communism is international in nature, that the
proletariat of all nations, irrespective of race, nationality, creed,
or color, constitutes a single class and must cooperate for the
ultimate victory of communism. This gives a feeling of solidarity
(communists always feel a part of a larger body, they don’t stand
alone); creates fanaticism (the feeling that as long as there are
noncommunist nations, communism is in danger, hence they must
be destroyed); promotes control of the international communist
movement by Soviet Russia (as the big brother of all other
Parties).</p>

<h4>PROLETARIAT:</h4>

<p>A key word in all communist literature, meaning workers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
(working class) who sell their “labor” in exchange for wages.
This “class” is extolled by the communists, and virtually everything
done by the Party is done in the name of the “proletariat” (as
“dictatorship of the proletariat”).</p>

<h4>PURGES:</h4>

<p>A characteristic inherent in communism whereby undesirable
members are expelled from the Party (or, when communism is
in state power, exiled or executed). To communists, purging is a
necessary technique to keep the Party “pure,” thereby creating
“better” members. “The Party becomes strong by purging itself
of opportunist elements.” (<i>Stalin</i>)</p>

<h4>REFORMISM (REFORMS, REFORMISTS):</h4>

<p>To communists, reforms in the social structure can have only
minor and passing beneficial results. Further, they delay the revolution.
Hence, “reformism” is a term of abuse, implying a “bourgeois”
or non-Marxist approach. The communists, however, like
to picture themselves as leaders of reform movements, not for
the purpose of improving economic or social conditions in society
but to exploit such movements to advance the cause of communism.
To communists reforms can often be a means to an end.</p>

<h4>REVOLUTION:</h4>

<p>The seizure of the government, if necessary by force and violence,
by the proletariat (working class) led by the Communist
Party, leading to the establishment of a Soviet state; called
<i>proletarian revolution</i>.</p>

<h4>SELF-CRITICISM:</h4>

<p>A communist technique ostensibly to detect and correct weaknesses
in Party life; actually to enforce communist discipline. The
Party member is encouraged to pursue a cold, relentless, realistic,
and constant examination of shortcomings and failures, both in
others and himself. Not to do so is regarded as “bourgeois” weakness
or sentimentalism. Communists teach: “Self-criticism is the
most important means for developing Communist consciousness and
thereby strengthening discipline and democratic centralism.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span></p>

<h4>SOCIALISM (MARXIST):</h4>

<p>1. The so-called “scientific” variety of socialism; that is,
Marxism-Leninism or Marxist scientific socialism. (See also <b>COMMUNISM
[MARXIST SCIENTIFIC SOCIALISM]</b>.)</p>

<p>2. In a limited meaning, “socialism” refers to the first or lower
stage of communism, which is the transitory period between the
seizure of power and the higher or final phase of communism. See
<b>COMMUNISM (stages of development)</b> for further details.</p>

<h4>SOCIALISM (NON-MARXIST):</h4>

<p>The communists have nothing but contempt for any form of
socialism except the Marxist-Leninist version. Non-Marxist socialists
are regarded as “utopian,” impractical, and allies of the
bourgeoisie.</p>

<h4>STATE:</h4>

<p>Communists regard all states to be organs of force and suppression
in the hands of the rulers. They bitterly denounce the
noncommunist state as an instrument of suppression, and blithely
assert that when full communism comes the state will “wither
away.” However, inside present communist states (where the
dictatorship of the proletariat is in power) the state has not
withered away but has become ever stronger, increasing communist
power and terror.</p>

<h4>TRANSMISSION BELTS:</h4>

<p>Refers to disguised mass organizations, which are used by
the Communist Party to spread or transmit communism to the
masses of people. “It is impossible to effect the dictatorship without
having a number of ‘transmission belts’ from the vanguard
to the masses of the advanced class, and from the latter to the
masses of the toilers.” (<i>Lenin</i>)</p>

<h4>UNITED FRONT:</h4>

<p>A revolutionary tactic designed to secure the support of noncommunists
for Party objectives. This generally involves Party
manipulation of noncommunist groups, usually on some current
issue such as “peace” or “civil rights,” whereby the Party, while
maintaining its independent role, cooperates with others to work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
for certain goals. To noncommunists the goal is advancement of
the good of society; to communists, the revolution.</p>

<h4>VANGUARD OF THE PROLETARIAT:</h4>

<p>Term applied to the role of the Communist Party as the leader
or teacher of the proletariat. Communists often talk of the Party
as the “general staff” of the revolution.</p>

<h4>WAR:</h4>

<p>1. Communists talk much about peace but feverishly prepare
for war. In Soviet Russia communist preparation takes the form
of military strength—the army, navy, air force; in the United
States, the organization of an active above-ground and underground
apparatus designed to wage “war” against noncommunist
society.</p>

<p>2. Communists believe that “war is a continuation of politics
by other means.” Marxism-Leninism divides wars into two major
categories, unjust and just. “Unjust” wars, according to the communists,
are wars started by the capitalists for purposes of exploitation
(“reactionary wars of conquest”). These wars, they say,
inevitably grow out of the “predatory” character of the capitalist
system. “Just” wars, on the other hand, are wars of “national
liberation”; that is, they promote the interests of the proletariat and
hinder the capitalists. In other words, a war is just (moral) if
the communists stand to gain; otherwise, it is unjust (immoral).
The communists classify, for example, Russia’s invasion of Finland
(1939) and entering World War II after Germany’s invasion
of Russia as just wars; World War II before Russia’s involvement
and the United Nations’ action in Korea (1950) as
unjust.</p>

<p>3. In the final analysis, Marxism-Leninism teaches that war
is absolutely necessary to bring about world-wide communism
wherever the advances of communism are resisted. This makes
Marxism-Leninism such a brutal concept. Lenin, in a letter to
American workers, wrote: “... history demands that the greatest
problems of humanity be solved by struggle and war.”</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="BIBLIOGRAPHY"><i>Bibliography of Major Communist “Classics”</i></h3>

</div>

<p>The theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism have been developed
by communist writers over a period of more than a
century. The works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, in the
Party’s eyes, are regarded as communist “classics.” “These books
are Communist classics. They contain the fundamental principles
and program of Communism. These are universal in their scope
and they are accepted by all Communist Parties, including our
own.” (<i>William Z. Foster</i>)</p>

<p>These writings, it must be remembered, are propaganda for the
communist movement. Written by highly partisan and prejudiced
minds, they are not based on scientific truth and accurate historical
research; nor are they attempts to determine truth as we in a free
society understand truth. These writers are trying to hammer
out the principles of violent revolution and, in the later writings
of Lenin and those of Stalin, to justify communism in state power
and to teach communists in other countries how to follow the
Bolshevik example. These listed works, although not intended to
be all-inclusive, are prime examples of how prejudice, thrown
into the stream of world opinion, has warped the minds and
personalities of so many millions of human beings.</p>

<h4>KARL MARX:</h4>

<p><i>Das Kapital</i> (<i>Capital</i>) is undoubtedly Marx’s best-known and
most important writing. It forms, in a literal sense, the cornerstone
of modern-day communism. The work is in three volumes: <i>Capitalist
Production</i> (1867), <i>Capitalist Circulation</i> (1885), <i>Capitalist
Production as a Whole</i> (1894). The final two volumes were completed
by Engels after Marx’s death. In this massive work Marx
attempted, using many statistics compiled from nineteenth-century
England, to prove that capitalism was doomed. To communists,
<i>Das Kapital</i> is “scientific” proof of the inevitability of communist
revolution. Time after time history has proved the errors, fallacious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
logic, and unscientific premises of the major thoughts contained
in <i>Das Kapital</i>; yet to communists the book is an infallible guide
to Party thought and action.</p>

<p>Another important work of Marx is <i>The Civil War in France</i>.
This work (which actually consists of three statements drafted
by Marx for the First International) was written in connection
with the Paris Commune, a revolutionary government set up in
Paris after the defeat of France by Prussia in 1870-71. Although
lasting only a few weeks, the Commune is regarded by communists
as the first working-class government in history. This
“classic” sets forth Marx’s view toward the existing state apparatus
of a “bourgeois” state: that is, the working class cannot confine
itself merely to taking over the state machinery; but the “bourgeois”
state must be utterly destroyed and replaced by the dictatorship
of the proletariat.</p>

<p><i>The Poverty of Philosophy</i> (1847) represents one of Marx’s
earliest works on economics, while <i>The Eighteenth Brumaire of
Louis Bonaparte</i> (1852) discusses, among other things, the character
of the “bourgeois” revolution. The latter work was written
concerning the activities of Louis Bonaparte, President of the Second
French Republic, who was later to become Emperor of France.
It must be noted that Marx (and also Engels and Lenin) were
acute observers of contemporary political, social, and economic
affairs; and their writings abound with references to current events
and personalities. Other works of Marx include: <i>Critique of Political
Economy</i> (1859), <i>Value, Price and Profit</i> (1865), and <i>Critique
of the Gotha Programme</i> (1875). In the latter, Marx develops
his idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the “withering
away” of the state.</p>

<p>Marx was a prolific letter-writer, corresponding with many
revolutionaries in England and abroad. The <i>Selected Correspondence
of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels</i> (1846-1895) shows how
the intimate collaboration of these two perverted minds gave
birth to the communist conspiracy.</p>

<h4>FRIEDRICH ENGELS:</h4>

<p>Engels, like Marx, was a voluminous writer. Some of his
better-known works are <i>The Peasant War in Germany</i> (1850),
<i>Germany: Revolution and Counter-Revolution</i> (1851-52), <i>The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
Housing Question</i> (1872), and <i>Anti-Dühring</i> (1877-78). The latter
work was written in reply to Eugen Dühring, a German professor
who had published what, in Engels’ opinion, were erroneous
ideas concerning materialism and socialism. Engels not only attacks
Dühring’s views but goes on to sketch the communist world outlook,
discussing dialectical and historical materialism, philosophy,
and political economy.</p>

<p>In <i>The Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State</i>
(1884), Engels endeavors to show the relationship of the family,
modes of production, and society. One of Engels’ latest writings on
materialism is <i>Ludwig Feuerbach and the Outcome of Classical
German Philosophy</i> (1886). His <i>Dialectics of Nature</i>, published
posthumously in 1927, is an attempt to discuss science from a
Marxist viewpoint.</p>

<h4>JOINT AUTHORSHIP OF MARX AND ENGELS:</h4>

<p>As is well known, Marx and Engels often cooperated in writing,
and sometimes it is difficult to determine exactly who wrote
what. The best-known product of their collaboration, of course, is
the <i>Communist Manifesto</i>. Engels, for example, wrote articles under
Marx’s name for the latter to send to the New York <i>Tribune</i>.
On the other hand, Engels, speaking of <i>Anti-Dühring</i>, said he read
the whole manuscript to Marx and that Marx himself contributed
a chapter.</p>

<h4>VLADIMIR I. LENIN:</h4>

<p>From roughly 1900 to his death, Lenin poured out pamphlet
after pamphlet justifying violent revolution and giving instructions
to his followers.</p>

<p>In <i>What Is To Be Done?</i> (1902), Lenin outlines the principles
which should determine the formation of a Leninist-type Party.
This was during the period of debate among Russian communists
on the type of Party organization, with Lenin favoring a restricted,
disciplined membership. In 1904, in <i>One Step Forward, Two Steps
Back</i>, Lenin continues his demand for a disciplined Party. In this
pamphlet he attacks his opponents, the Mensheviks. This attack
was continued in <i>Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic
Revolution</i> (1905). <i>Materialism and Empirio-Criticism</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
(1909), a philosophical treatise, represents one of Lenin’s major
works.</p>

<p>In the years that followed, Lenin continued studying and writing.
In 1917 <i>Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism</i> appeared,
in which Lenin develops the thesis that imperialism is the
final state of monopoly capitalism. He characterized World War I
as imperialistic on both sides. This work was destined to leave a
lasting imprint on communist thinking. The term “imperialistic” is
today one of the communists’ favorite terms of attack against the
free world.</p>

<p><i>State and Revolution</i> (1918), in which Lenin studies the relationship
of revolutionary theory to the state, is probably his clearest
blueprint for violent revolution. It has been extensively used by
communists in the United States.</p>

<p>Another major work of Lenin, published in 1920 after the
Bolshevik revolution, is <i>“Left-Wing” Communism, an Infantile
Disorder</i>. Lenin here is writing from the viewpoint of communism
in state power and giving advice to revolutionary movements outside
Russia. He is telling other communists how “he did it in Russia,”
especially warning them to be careful about ineffective left-wing
tendencies. This work did much to consolidate the world communist
movement and the Third International.</p>

<p>Of special interest to the United States is Lenin’s <i>A Letter to
American Workers</i> (1918). In this letter Lenin reports to “the
American worker” about the Russian revolution. Communists in
this country have always considered this communication a symbol
of the Russian dictator’s interest in the American proletariat. In
truth, the letter reveals how, in communist hands, America’s history
and struggle for freedom would be distorted by Marxist manipulation.</p>

<h4>JOSEPH V. STALIN:</h4>

<p>Stalin was not as prodigious a writer as Marx, Engels, and
Lenin. Included in his outstanding works are <i>Foundations of Leninism</i>
(1924) and <i>Marxism and the National Question</i> (1913), a
study of communism in relation to nationality groups. In the former,
Stalin attempted to show that Lenin did not merely rediscover
and reapply Marxism to his day but also developed it further.
Given as a series of lectures at Sverdlov University, Moscow, this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
work discusses basic communist concepts, such as the dictatorship
of the proletariat, the peasant problem, strategy and tactics, and
the Party.</p>

<p>In addition, Stalin has claimed to be the genius behind the <i>History
of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)</i>
(1938). In <i>Joseph Stalin, A Political Biography</i> (issued by the
Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute), it is stated that the <i>History</i> was
written by Stalin and approved by a commission of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This book
was a “short-course” history of the Bolshevik movement in which
the various phases of Party development were stressed. It was
widely distributed in Russia and also used by the Communist
Party, USA.</p>

<p>Very interestingly, Nikita Khrushchev made mention of this work
in his famous denunciation of Stalin at the Twentieth Party Congress
of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Khrushchev told
how originally the book was described as written by a commission
of the Party’s Central Committee “under the direction of Comrade
Stalin and with his most active personal participation....” This,
however, according to Khrushchev, did not satisfy Stalin, so the
wording was changed to read “written by Comrade Stalin and approved
by a commission of the Central Committee....” “As you
see,” Khrushchev said, “a surprising metamorphosis changed the
work created by a group into a book written by Stalin. It is not
necessary to state how and why this metamorphosis took place.”</p>

that have taken more than forty years to uncover.
These are the facts that Americans do <span class="u">not</span> know about
communism.</p>

<p class="noindent">This is the exposé of the Communist Party from its
beginning down to the present. It tells who the
communists are, what they claim to be, why people
become communists and why they break away from
the Party.</p>

<p class="noindent">Here is the picture of what life is like within the Party—the
inside story of communist strategy and methods
of mass agitation, the inner workings of its espionage
and sabotage activities.</p>

<p class="noindent">Here is the vivid and shocking picture of what this
country would be like under a communist system, and
what you can do to fight this ever-present danger.</p>
